<p> Why does this day SUCK so BAD? </p>

<p>You'd think a sick brotha like me could sleep through the fucking night . . . no dice. I'm up and down every fucking hour with these God Damned delirious, dehydrated hallucinations.</p>

<p>Then I get up, what do we got to eat? Fucking Cocoa Pebbles, or as I like to call them: Crispy Cat Droppings. Any O.J.? Oh HELL no! Any milk? OH FUCK NO!</p>

<p>So, how about lunch. No Chicken Noodle of ANY kind! Plenty of BEAN with fucking BACON, though.</p>

<p>How about some grape juice, that sounds like it'll hit the spot. Oh, I forgot! I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO DOES THE DISHES IN A TIMELY MANNER AROUND HERE! And, everyone in the family seems to think it's their JOB to waste a new glass every time they need a sip of fucking water. Jesus Christ! They all drink the same shit! Soda and fucking Water! If we all stuck to one glass a day, there'd be PLENTY when the fucking maid goes down with a fucking God-damned cold!</p>

<p>{{Hey, I have a GREAT idea! Why don't we give Steve diarrhea? Yeah! Make him go to the fucking can twelve times a day! He'll LOVE that!}}</p>

<p>That's it, I ain't leavin' this fucking room, I ain't speaking to anyone, consider this day officially fucking OVER.</p>

<p>Current Mood: Big stinky vage-whiner
<br />Current Music: All Jimi All The Time (Tax Free)

<br />Rodger. We're gonna try "Brown Leather Coat" (with the gay ass name) and see how that stands up.

<br />It looks better, but it's a little bland for your psycho personality ;)

<br />OK, I'm hoping THIS is less bland. Psycho isn't as easy as it looks, color-scheme-wise

<br />Still bland, but you're right...psycho is hard to convey through colors.
