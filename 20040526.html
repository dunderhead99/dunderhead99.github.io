<p> You're talking to Mr. Sanitary As Fuck for the next few days as I battle to relieve my body of this accursed plague. I will NOT let this cold keep me down.</p>

<p>{{But, Steve, if you'd just washed your hands more and avoided the sickies around your house in the FIRST place, then you wouldn't be in this situation!}}</p>

<p>Quiet, Brain, or I'll stab you with a Q-Tip!</p>

<p>Right now, we're just in the sore throat with a side order of snot-blowing. This, I can manage. Once the nasal floodgates open, though, my room will be a cesspool. Just imagine, floating in a sea of egg whites. THAT'S what my nose can accomplish in just a few days if I don't NY Quil the FUCK out of this thing. Oh NY Quil, I love you! You giant fucking Q! </p>

<p>Yes, that's me hallucinating. The Mariners are not losing today's baseball game! It's a miracle and it's already the SECOND inning.</p>


<p>"If I was gonna give you something you need, I'd give you moustache wax and a t-shirt that says 'One Cock at a Time'" -- If you don't have the comedy album with this here quote, then you ain't livin', buster.</p>
