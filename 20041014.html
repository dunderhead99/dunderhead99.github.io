<p> New Work Schedule:</p>

<p>Monday-Friday 7am-3pm, $9.96/hour, through October 29th.</p>

<p>Now, take that, and the $180+ dollars I'm making from painting; I don't wanna say I'm healed. Far from it, considering the amount of debt I've managed to compile. Let's just say I'll be breathing easier.</p>

<p>Although, getting up at 5am is gonna suck a few balls, I'm not gonna lie to you.</p>

<p>I guess the four hours at the employment office, watching stupid videos and taking dumbass tests might just pay off.</p>

<p>Current Mood: Wheezy
<br />Current Music: David Bowie - Lady Stardust</p>
