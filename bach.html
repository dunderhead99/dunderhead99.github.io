Sebastian & Axl, Sitting In A Tree, R-O-C-K-I-N-G.

</h1>

<h6>

<p>Oh my GOD, I'm losing my MIND!</p>

<p>So, I just downloaded the new Sebastian Bach album -</p>

<p>{{for those not in the know, he was lead singer of a late 80s heavy metal band Skid Row that was one of the good ones for approximately two albums and an EP before hitting the 90s and sucking hardcore}}</p>

<p>- and it features Axl Rose on three of the fourteen tracks -</p>

<p>{{for those not in the know, Axl was lead singer of Guns N' Roses, who I obsess about constantly and is supposedly releasing an album entitled "Chinese Democracy" sometime within this next century (because I can't spell millenium right now)}}</p>

<p>- and while the three songs are not GREAT -</p>

<p>{{for those not in the know, they WOULD'VE been great if they were produced in the late 80s/early 90s when both singers were in their prime, but that's neither here nor there}}</p>

<p>- they're fucking AWESOME and they show the potential for what Axl's Chinese Democracy COULD be -</p>

<p>- he's not what he was back in 1991, but he showed flashes there in moments of those three songs that get my vagina all wet and throbbing -</p>

<p>- I have to go drink more wine at a party now, otherwise I'd gush further, but I can't wait to listen to the rest of this Sebastian Bach album because while I wasn't the biggest "Hair Metal" fan in the world -</p>

<p>{{for those not in the know, indeed I'm kinda glad that Quiet Riot singer died last week; he was a tool and they sucked a bucket of dicks}}</p>

<p>- Skid Row was a little more hardcore than the rest of those Pussy Poseurs; plus they had a song entitled "Get The Fuck Out" which, when you're 10 years old, is the most badass title of a song of all time -</p>

<p>{{for those not in the know, when you're ten years old and Get The Fuck Out is also the chorus of said badass song, it's also the most badass chorus of all time}}</p>
