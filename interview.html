An Interview With Steven A. Taylor.

</h1>

<h6>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Is there anywhere you'd like to begin?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Huh?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Can you ...</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Hang on, what?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Can you take off your headphones?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - They're off.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - OK, so as I was -</p>

<p>

<strong>Approaching Woman</strong> - Excuse me, I'm all turned around here.  Can you tell me where 30 Rockefeller Center is at?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Yeah, you're gonna walk down that street, take a left and you're there.</p>

<p>

<strong>Approaching Woman</strong> - Uhh ... thank you.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - That wasn't the way, you know.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - She doesn't know that.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - That's funny to you?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - I guess.  It's just easier.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Easier than saying, "I don't know"?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Yeah.  It comes without explanation.  I live here, I'm supposed to know where the tourists flock.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - You've never been to 30 -</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - It's hotter than tits out here!</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Yeah, it's what, 90 degrees out?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Is that part of the interview?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - What ... that?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Because, if you wanted to interview someone about the weather -</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Oh, no, it's just ... my editor said -</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - I mean, I know a guy.  He <em>does</em> the weather.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - No, that's OK, it's just that my old high school newspaper editor told me I should - whenever conducting an interview - I should get a rapport going -</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - He could probably stand out here and tell you how hot it is without any instruments or anything.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - My <em>editor</em>?  ... Or, no -</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - What's your name again?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Uhh, St-Steven.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Do you stutter often, Kevin?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Uhh, no.  And, um, my name is actually - </p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - You and I have a lot in common, Kevin.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Yes, like first names.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - My name's not Kevin!</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Neither is -</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - You should really - </p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - mine.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - pay attention.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - So, Steven, where do you get your ideas?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Yep.  A lot in common.  We're both writers ... well, I <em>assume</em> you're a writer.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - I am.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Have I read you in anything?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Well, I run this website, Sycophant Picnic.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Oh.  I don't believe I'm familiar.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - We ... we commissioned this interview.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - You did?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Yes.  I talked to you personally.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - No, no I talked to some guy named Stephen.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Yeah, that was me.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Kevin, look, you didn't have to use a fake name to try and impress me.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - I didn't!  I -</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Anyway, you'll let me know when we've started the interview, right?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Certainly.  How about -</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Because I've got some things I could be doing.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - I understand.  How about now?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Go ahead.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Steven -</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Yes, Kevin.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Where do you get your ideas for the things you write?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Do you want the long answer or the short?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Either one.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Well, they just sort of come to me.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Would you care to elaborate?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Can we go off the record with this one?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Of course.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - You look really familiar, Kevin.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Steven.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Have you ever seen that old Patty Duke Show?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Can we get back to the interview?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Yes, the interview.  On with the record, my good man.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - What?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Kevin, what would you say to me pleasuring myself right now?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Please don't.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Are you sure?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Steven, are you on any prescription medication?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - I know a guy!  He can get you anything you need.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - No thanks, I'm fine.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Also does the weather.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Yes, I think you mentioned him.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Well, I don't know about you, but I think this interview went splendidly.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - But ... I only asked one question!</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Nonsense!  We've been here for at least an hour and I'm sweating like a porpoise!</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - We've been here not ten minutes -</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Oh, let's just agree to disagree.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - And porpoises don't sweat.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Would you like an autograph?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - I ... fine.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - OK, Kevin.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Please, make it out to Steven.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - OK ... "Stephen.  Stay ... cool ..."</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Actually, it's spelled with a 'V'.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - "and ... don't ... P ... in my ... Ool.  Your ... pal, Dennis ... Rodman."</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - You're not Dennis Rodman.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - I know.  But, by devaluing his autograph with all these counterfeits, I stand to increase the worth of my own.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - I hate to break it to you, but there really isn't much of a market for Dennis Rodman autographs anymore.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Yeah.  <em>Now</em>.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Well, thanks ... <em>Dennis</em>.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Steven.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Yes, I know, I was -</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Then why'd you call me Dennis?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - I wasn't!  I mean, because of the autograph and -</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Look, just because I write hilarious notes and sign them as Dennis Rodman doesn't mean I'm gonna start pulling down 19 boards against the New Orleans Jazz.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Utah.  They're the ... Utah Jazz.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Nonsense!  There's no music in Utah.  Do your homework, son.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Steven, what's next for your writing career?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - I'm thinking about opening a pizza shop.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - That's not really ... writing-related, though.</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - I've always wanted to be surrounded by toppings all day, you know?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Oh ... <em>yeah</em>.  So, do you plan on writing a short story about a murderous pizza shop owner who carves up hobos and serves them on pies to his customers?</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - What?  No!  Dammit, I want to make <em>pizza</em>!  Real pizza; I don't want to -</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - Then there could be this repeat customer who keeps ordering The Special - yeah, you could call the story, 'The Special' - and he keeps ordering The Special until he turns into this, like, Cannibal-Zombie creature, which leads to him stalking the pizza store owner, chopping <em>him</em> up and -</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 2</strong> - Dammit!  <em>Pizza</em>!  This interview is over!</p>

<p>

<strong>Steven 1</strong> - having sex with the Pizza-Store-Owner Pie!  Steven!  Think about it!</p>
