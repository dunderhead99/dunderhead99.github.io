Ramming Home A Victory With Ramming Speed.

</h1>

<h6>

<p>If anybody knows the pain of fumbling on your final offensive possession in a divisional game you probably should've won, it's the Seattle Seahawks.</p>

<p>The Rams are always a tough play for the Seahawks; their offense is stacked with stars and their defense somehow manages to rise to the occasion (as opposed to just shuffling over to it, har har har). The only difference between now and years past is the fact that their o-line blocks like a ceremonial ribbon against a giant pair of scissors. Without Marc Bulger, they have no chance.</p>

<p>Losing to Gus Frerotte is not an option!</p>

<p>Can I just say that I think our defense is truly amazing? If all things stay healthy, they might just lead us to the promised land this year. Finally, we've got two cornerbacks who can lock down the opposing receiving tandem of Bruce and Holt! Kelly Jennings was on his man like a fucking tattoo all game, and that pick by Marcus Trufant was off the motherfucking hook. They brought the ghetto to the field today and made Gus Frerotte look like Gus Frerotte. And that doesn't even begin to explain how Lofa Tatupu made Steven Jackson his bitch. Sure, Jackson had a 53-yard TD run, but he only got 37 yards on the other 22 carries and had to leave the game momentarily after getting the shit levelled upon him on one of those. And can I just say ... Patrick Kerney is the greatest white d-lineman since Joe Nash? Three more sacks today giving him seven in the last three games; all wins. When we play like that, it's no fucking wonder the Rams went scoreless in the second half.</p>

<p>By the way, I know that rushing the football isn't our strongest suit, but Matt Hasselbeck is going to get himself killed back there with these defenses blitzing on every down! I know Mo Morris isn't the second coming of Earl Campbell, but you're gonna have to use him more than 16 times a game if you want your star quarterback taking snaps in the playoffs. That having been said, huge props to the bald man for stepping up even though he missed practice all week (and it showed). We can't do this every week though, because if Hasselbeck goes in there rusty against Philly next week, odds are they won't be pushed over like the Frerotte-led Rams.</p>

<p>7-4 feels nice, but this was WAY too close to a disaster for comfort. Leonard Weaver's first career TD gave me only a few moments of relief in a game that never should've been as tense as it was. It's just too bad those Cleveland and Arizona games didn't bounce in our favor; we'd be in excellent position after this week's Dallas/Green Bay showdown. Nevertheless, that third seed is still ours, and the division is all but wrapped up thanks to the 49ers taking care of business over the Cardinals in overtime today.</p>

<p>P.S. I'm so elated that I can use the Big Lebowski line - "I Hate The Fucking Eagles, Man!" - from now until next Sunday. Also, I fucking hate these fucking 1:00 games, but I'm kinda looking forward to sitting in the giggling waitress's section</p>
