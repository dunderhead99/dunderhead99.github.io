<p> I hate painting.</p>

<p>I hate the Yankees.</p>

<p>I hate the NL matchup.</p>

<p>I hate paint flecks falling from the house into my hair.</p>

<p>I LOVE this bigger, flat-screen monitor.</p>

<p>I hate finding a place to keep my old monitor just in case, there ain't no fuckin' room.</p>

<p>I love the taste of Jim Beam. It's no Jack, but in a tight pinch, it comes up big.</p>

<p>I love the show Sledge Hammer.</p>

<p>I hate watching multiple presidential debates.</p>

<p>I hate Fox News but I hate CNN even more because they never SHOW ANY NEWS.</p>

<p>_________________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>I was up till five am last night watching Ren & Stimpy while drinking Jim and Coke with Jake. And then I woke up at 11. My brain is fried.</p>

<p>_________________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>I love Pedro Martinez's little midget.</p>

<p>I hate how the Storm could easily handle the Sonics in an exhibition game.</p>

<p>I hate how the Storm won a championship before the Seahawks and Mariners.</p>

<p>I hate how the best team of this year in Seattle IS the Storm.</p>

<p>You know, just fuck the Storm. Fuck the WNBA. Nobody gives a damn about that fucking league. Fuck how the Storm sells more tickets than the Sonics.</p>

<p>Current Mood: Turds of the World
<br />Current Music: David Bowie - Ziggy Stardust</p>
