Big Sarah's Big Birthday Song Epic.

</h1>

<h6>

<p class="center">Haven't you seen,
<br />Haven't you heard,
<br />It's the birthday,
<br />Of a really big nerd.</p>

<p class="center">It's someone you know,


<br />No she isn't obese,
<br />But, if it's cake you're eating,
<br />She'll take a John Goodman-sized piece.</p>

<p class="center">And tonight she'll drink,
<br />Until she's green in the face,
<br />Stumbling over to the can,
<br />To spew all over the place.</p>

<p class="center">She'll make racist remarks
<br />To minorities all night,
<br />And she'll piss off the wrong Asian,
<br />To start a Kung Fu fight.</p>

<p class="center">She says, "Me Chinese,
<br />Me play joke,
<br />Me go pee pee
<br />In your Coke!"</p>

<p class="center">The fists start to fly
<br />And some teeth fall out
<br />Big Sarah goes down
<br />Losing in a black-belt rout</p>

<p class="center">But she gets up and says,
<br />"For this you must die,"
<br />The Asian laughs and returns,
<br />"Bring it on, Round Eye."</p>

<p class="center">Sarah gets in her stance,
<br />Showing off fists of fury,
<br />And pops the Asian twice in the eyes,
<br />Making his vision all blurry.</p>

<p class="center">Three more shots to the face,
<br />And one in the sack,
<br />Then she jumps on top
<br />Riding him like a hog, bare back</p>

<p class="center">All around the bar and into the street,
<br />Can be heard, the shouts, "Mush mush"
<br />The winos outside point and laugh,
<br />"Look at that big, scary lush!"</p>

<p class="center">A dragon flies down from the sky,
<br />A fiery message he's got,
<br />But Sarah slays the beast,
<br />By stabbing him in the throat a lot.</p>

<p class="center">Then enters Walker Texas Ranger
<br />With his brand of Texas fight,
<br />Sarah whips out her numchucks,
<br />Beats Walker with all her might.</p>

<p class="center">Don't forget Bruce Lee,
<br />Back from the dead
<br />A roundhouse kick to the temple
<br />Knocks off the Green Hornet's head</p>

<p class="center">Enter Sulu
<br />With Captain Kirk and Spock,
<br />Sarah shoots them all dead
<br />With her phaser, not her glock.</p>

<p class="center">Finally fed up,
<br />Steve walks out to say,
<br />"All this killing must cease,
<br />And it must cease today."</p>

<p class="center">Steve pulls out his bazooka,
<br />Takes a moment to aim,
<br />He fires one window-rattling shot,
<br />But the result is the same.</p>

<p class="center">Sarah jumps twenty feet
<br />Into the air
<br />The shot misses completely,
<br />Not even messing her hair.</p>

<p class="center">The battle ensues,
<br />She's finally met a worthy foe,
<br />Locked in a battle to the death,
<br />Matching Steve blow for blow.</p>

<p class="center">Then she remembers Steve's weakness,
<br />Making a desperate last ditch call,
<br />For the bartender to bring out
<br />Gallons and gallons of alcohol.</p>

<p class="center">Steve's unable to resist,
<br />The pleasing, addictive taste,
<br />He starts drinking and she starts beating
<br />Him all over the place.</p>

<p class="center">Steve's block is knocked off,
<br />The battle is done;
<br />Everyone good has been slain,
<br />Only evil has won</p>

<p class="center">But wait, who's that?
<br />Just like a movie in the Old West,
<br />Jesus appears,
<br />Citing that only He is the best.</p>

<p class="center">They stare each other down,
<br />Ignoring the live and the slain,
<br />Jesus calls out, "Draw,"
<br />Sarah throws a dreidel through His brain</p>

<p class="center">"Now the time has come,"
<br />Sarah says to the mass
<br />"For the Jews to rule since, once again,
<br />We have killed that self-righteous ass!"</p>

<p class="center">With her enemies vanquished,
<br />And her honor in place,
<br />Sarah pulls out Jesus's heart,
<br />Rubbing the blood all over her face</p>

<p class="center">All her friends inside cheer,
<br />As Sarah lets out a triumphant roar
<br />Then everyone gets naked,
<br />Has an orgy in the gore.</p>

<p class="center">Many died on Big Sarah's birthday,
<br />But that's nothing new;
<br />All the weary survivors joined hands and sang,
<br />"Happy birthday to you!"</p>
