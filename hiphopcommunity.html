Wu-Tang is Here Forever, Motherfuckers!.

</h1>

<h6>

<p>There's been a lot of racism going around recently, hasn't there? Sort of like the flu, it's been spreading to prominent people all over. Every time one of these white celebrities goes down for something stupid they've said, there's always the same counterargument given by the devil's advocate:</p>

<p>Well, this all comes back to the Hip Hop Community and why should THEY be allowed to say bitches and hos and niggers; well they shouldn't, that's what I say, and maybe the black leaders, the Jesse Jacksons and the Al Sharptons, maybe they should be going after these rappers; because you don't have to be black to be offended by racism and blah blah blah.</p>

<p>First of all, could we all stop calling it The Hip Hop Community? You sound about as stupid as the people who came up with "Grunge Music" and "Generation X". It's not like there's some band of people out there all thinking as one and voting as one through their shared affinity for Hip Hop music. Oh man, if we don't get this legislation passed to legalize 40s, I'm gonna send our Hip Hop Community Lobbyists to Washington to grease some palms.</p>

<p>Second of all, people who make rap music - by and large - are stupid motherfuckers. I'm not saying they're ALL ignorant, and I'm not saying that many of them don't have smart business sense (they know how to milk the cow that is the American Music Consumer), but they're stupid motherfuckers. That's why they're so popular with today's youth. Because today's youth are comprised of - by and large - stupid motherfuckers.</p>

<p>Of course, that isn't to say that the large portion of today's adults and today's seniors aren't stupid motherfuckers as well. We're a country of stupid God-damned motherfuckers.</p>

<p>If I had to go out on a limb, I'd say that the smartest man in Hip Hop right now is Chuck D. Where's Chuck D? Not making relevant Rap music, if ANY Rap music at all. Why is that? Because people who belong in Rap music's core audience don't want to be educated about what's plaguing this country and what's plaguing Black people.</p>

<p>Who are the Hip Hop artists right now in the Top 10? Timbaland, Paul Wall, and someone named Akon. I haven't heard any songs by any of these guys' albums, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and say there's little-to-nothing about the discrepency of African Americans in prison vs. African Americans who go to college. In fact, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say there are more references in these songs glorifying prison and things you can do to GET you to prison than there are references to college and things you can do to GET you to college. Just a hunch, I know I'm taking a pretty big leap there.</p>

<p>Rappers are fucking morons, rap music fans are fucking morons - but rap music is POPULAR - so they're going to continue doing and saying what's worked for the last couple decades. You can say the same thing about "Heavy Metal" music in the 80s and today. Just trade computers for instruments and black guys and jewelry with white guys and long hair. Same fucking subject matter, same fucking IQs.</p>

<p>You wanna know why it's pointless to "condemn" the Hip Hop Community for saying the same things that bring down Michael Richards and Don Imus? Because we have certain expectations for most people that we don't have for rappers and rap fans. Nobody expects the Hip Hop Community to change; we're all just happy if our rappers refrain from killing each other. You can't bring down an entire genre of popular music because a vocal minority takes umbrage with the subject matter. But, you can easily take down one man, because then you're a vocal majority going up against a racist redneck.</p>

<p>You want my advice, Black Leaders? Just go after one rapper. 50-Cent. He sucks.</p>
