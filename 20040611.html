<p>Pig Vomit - "She Had Her Period" (((These aren't the kind of lyrics you get out of a normal Livejournal user)))</p>

<p>She said she loved me
<br />And that she'd let me in her pants
<br />I had a healthy boner,
<br />Now I had my chance</p>

<p>She held her secrets
<br />Though she denies it to this day
<br />I got my first taste of love
<br />In such a bitter way</p>

<p>She had her PERIOD
<br />She had her PEEEERIOD</p>

<p>Both of us were screamin'
<br />Down my face her blood was streamin'
<br />And it glistened in the dashboard lights</p>

<p>She had her PERIOD
<br />I was an IDIOT</p>

<p>I should have just plunged my apendage
<br />Way down deep into her hemmorage
<br />That niiiiiiight</p>

<p>Went to a drive-in movie
<br />Love in the back seat of my car
<br />I was a cunning linguist
<br />Did I go too far?</p>

<p>Such menstruation
<br />Should be plugged up before it drains
<br />Did she go without a tampon
<br />Due to lack of brains?</p>

<p>She had her PERIOD
<br />She had a PEEEERIOD
<br />Just like rain down my face, ba-bay</p>

<p>Both of us were screamin'
<br />Down my face her blood was streamin'
<br />And it glistened in the dashboard lights</p>

<p>She had her PERIOD
<br />I was an IDIOT</p>

<p>I should have just plunged my apendage
<br />Way down deep into her hemmorage
<br />That niiiiiiight</p>
