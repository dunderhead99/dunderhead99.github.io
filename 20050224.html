Formatting my MP3 player, maybe this'll learn me not to drop it again.

<p> Bah, to hell with this! I've got to go back to fucking Tacoma to get the final piece de resistance for the costume. It's either that, or try to find a store around here that would have it. I mean, it's not like it's all that expensive, it's just that I'd have to FIND it, and if I can't, then I gotta go to Tacoma fucking anyway because I KNOW I've got it. I can tell you right where it is. Old desk, top right drawer. Fuck.</p>

<p>Not that I really want to be spending any more money anyway. I mean, fuck me, ever since I got that $1500 from my life insurance policy cash-in (Quothe the grandmother who did all the legwork in getting me that money: "You'll never find Life Insurance for that cheap again." Yeah, because I DON'T want $1500 and . . . you know what, why don't you tack on another bill while you're at it. I sure as fuck know all the other 23 year olds without even fucking HEALTH insurance are considering paying for their own deaths so the burden upon their families are significantly reduced. So, let me get this straight, I can't have this boil on my ass looked at by a doctor, but if the boil KILLS me, then my family's all set. Yeah, where can I fucking sign up for that one?) I have been spending money like a madman. Just to illustrate to you HOW much money I've been spending; in my fridge right now, I have TWO CAKES! TWO CAKES! No, I don't, but I DO have two chocolate milks (on sale for $2.50 each). </p>

<p>I'll tell you what, though, the CD collection isn't hurting as a result of this sudden upswing of the karma money pendulum. Check out the new buys:</p>

<p>James - Laid
<br />Pavement - Slanted & Enchanted
<br />Kings of Leon - Aha Shake Heartbreak
<br />Butthole Surfers - Hairway to Steven
<br />James Brown - Live At The Apollo
<br />Cancer Conspiracy - The Audio Medium
<br />Kinski - Don't Climb On And Take The Holy Water
<br />Jaco Pastorius - The Birthday Concert
<br />Al Green - Greatest Hits
<br />Pretty Girls Make Graves - Good Health
<br />These Arms Are Snakes - The Lion Sleeps When Its Antelope Go Home</p>

<p>That last one, These Arms Are Snakes, that's this kickass local band I heard on The Young & The Restless (funny, what a local rock band was doing on a national daytime soap, har har). I gotta find out if they're playing any shows around here before they make it to the bigtime and their ticket prices start going from reasonable to OUTRAGEOUS. God Damn U2 with their Kings of Leon opening and their 60+ dollar tickets, when all I want is a small club show with ONLY Kings of Leon! I mean, Jesus, I'm not 10; the prospect of going to a U2 concert no longer appeals to me. You bring back 1991 and I'll THINK about it. Then again, if you bring back 1991, I'm gonna be hittin' PLENTY of other shows, trust.</p>

<p>Hey, here's an idea, it's a quarter to five in the morning. Why not walk out into the freezing cold and walk my stinky-ass dog? Every fucking day I get home from work and carry him through the building (evidently there's this policy where your pets aren't allowed to walk through the halls, but unlike these fucking cat-owners around here, my dog doesn't piss and shit indoors), and when I put him down, my hand smells like STINKY DOG! Every fucking day I smell my hand and I tell him he's getting a bath when we return. And every fucking day I fucking forget to give him a fucking bath.</p>

<p>Really, somebody, please, put me out of my fucking misery</p>

<p>Current Mood: Running and passing gas
<br />Current Music: Kings of Leon - Slow Night, So Long</p>
