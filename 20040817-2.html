<p> 14 Shutout Innings Later ...</p>

<p>Yes, today I was on. First game, complete game shutout 5-hitter, winning 16-0 with Josh on my team.</p>

<p>Game two, Josh started, I relieved a couple of times early on, but he made it through the fifth inning to qualify for the win. Then, it was Steve-Time. Got the save, thanks to a HERCULEAN effort. 25 runs scored, while Josh only gave up 12 runs in his four innings.</p>

<p>So, in one day, I got a win and a save, ran my record to 13-0 (17-0 over all), lowered my ERA 47 points to 2.94</p>

<p>Also, I have WRITTEN the rules. Three pages jam packed of Backyard Baseball rules and regulations. I'll be more than happy to send them to anyone who's willing, just as soon as I make the final revisions.</p>

<p>You know you're scared. </p>

<p>Also, the pictures are finished and I'll get them developed tomorrow. Kon, your life's greatest achievement of jumping into the Punchbowl will FINALLY have visual proof for anyone to see.</p>

<p>Current Mood: Arm ... is dead
<br />Current Music: Poison - Unskinny Bop</p>
