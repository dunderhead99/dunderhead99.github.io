<p> Marooned for a week in Tacoma, Washington.</p>

<p>Let's take a trip down memory lane, shall we? </p>

<p>Sunday: hopes of winning 100 dollars crushed as Green Bay beats Houston. Asleep by 10.
<br />Monday: wake at 5am, leave for work at 6:10, home at 4:30, eat dinner. Asleep by 6.
<br />Tuesday: wake at 3am, breakfast of two frozen pizzas, run at 5am.</p>

<p>This is my life, ladies n' gentlemen. Do you REALIZE how drab and dreary life is when I'm not out partying in Seattle? The quality of my posts suffer as a result. That's why you get this. I may as well be like all the other fockers . . . my turkey sandwich was a little dry today . . . my dog threw up on the blanket we use to cover up the chair so the other dog won't get hair all over it . . . watched another wonderful episode of Coach today . . . Craig T. Nelson is the second greatest actor of our generation behind the guy who played Major Dad ... you know, they should really bring Major Dad back ...</p>

<p>To shake things up a bit, to add a little more excitement into my life, I think today I'm gonna clip my toenails BEFORE I clip my fingernails.</p>

<p>I wouldn't be adverse to a mysterious assassin walking up behind me today with a lone bullet in the chamber and a nonsensical vendetta. COME ON PEOPLE! I know one of you HAS to have the desire to kill me! . . . (wait, if you know I want it, it'll be like you're doing me a favor)</p>

<p>OK, so for the record, DON'T kill me (*wink wink*)</p>

<p>Current Mood: I'm goin' down to shoot my old lady, Caught her messin' round with another man
<br />Current Music: Jimi Hendrix - Hey Baby (New Rising Sun) Live At Berkeley</p>
