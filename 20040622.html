<p> Huh. This is a first. Complaining about a job I don't even have yet. (By the way, this is my way of dealing with the fact that I'm such a pussmore, I can't even cope with the fact that I HAVE to work to make money, so bear with me)</p>

<p>and he's got big balls, and she's got big balls, BUT WE'VE GOT THE BIGGEST BALLS OF THEM ALL!!! ((Yes, I must remember these words from the drunk-n-lovin'-it Bon Scott))</p>

<p>See, here's the deal. Tomorrow I get to put on my suit (black khakis and gray button-down shirt, no tux for this luxury man) and tie (yes, my ONLY tie), and put myself through an actual 9-5 shift. Just like you see on TV, only it's my life and IT SUCKS THE BIGGEST BALLS OF THEM ALL!!!</p>

<p>I always thought of myself, after college, kickin' it around with mindless easy bumfuck work, as few hours as possible for as little scratch as I need, until I could get my writing career off the ground. Too bad, all my ideas are excellent in theory, but only a rare few actually see a proper completion. Such is the life of the artist, though. Poor until you die, and then your loved ones get rich off of your name. I WANT THAT! WHY NOT ME??? </p>

<p>No, I gotta be Mr. Man (I know, some of you say I use that term loosely, well BACK OFF!). I gotta be Mr. Suit and Tie and fucking 9 to 5 in Federal Fucking Way because I'm working on a 300 dollar debt and living with a car that won't make it past November, and I'm in a household right now that, if my dad is forced to go on strike, won't be my household long enough to even SEE my car die in November. </p>

<p>See, here's the bottom line: I need to start making money and fucking saving money in a big fucking hurry so I can be more of a help than a burden. For the last year, I haven't asked for a dime in money, only food and shelter. Well, it's time to start pitching in now, which means I have to say something I've lived my whole life trying not to say.</p>

<p>I need this job.</p>

<p>Not, "I want this job." I said that before last summer and it came in handy. No, now I NEED this job and I need it by the end of the month.</p>

<p>So, allow me to put on my Serious Face for just one day; for just 8 hours. Allow me to impress these needle-dicked fucks over at So-&-So Marketing so I can be let onto the payroll and start my way up the company fucking ladder. Towing the company line. Yes Sir, boss! I'm-a heer fer ya, boss! Can I shine yer shoes, boss? Shall I spread some vaseline on my ass crack fer ya boss, or do yer jus' wanna penertrate me dry? You know, boss, I do anything fer yoo, boss!</p>

<p>What's that on my nose? You don't want to know what that brown smudge is. Ass-kissing will only get you so far in this world; as it happens, I'm about to enroll in Honors Ass Kissing 401. Hopefully, I'm up to sniff . . . er, snuff.</p>

<p>Current Mood: Sucked 36 dicks! -- In a row?
<br />Current Music: AC/DC - Big Balls</p>

<p>one day he just might become, supervisor
