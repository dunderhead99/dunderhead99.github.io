Not This Year!.

</h1>

<h6>

<p>The Seahawks may be a far cry from what a Super Bowl team is supposed to be, but dammit they came out fighting yesterday!</p>

<p>I know we're only 6-4 and we frittered away a couple games we should've won on the road and Green Bay and Dallas refuse to blink in this inferior of conferences and we're locked and loaded into the 3-seed with assured road games in the playoffs and still only one game up on Arizona with a showdown at the Q next month ... but right now I couldn't be more pleased with this football team.</p>

<p>Of course, all of that will blow away faster than a dandelion in a hurricane if we don't follow this win with a thorough stomping in St. Louis next weekend, but I'll have you know I was grinning a mile wide last night (and not just because the Jets made fools of those damned Steelers in overtime).</p>

<p>Just like that we were down 10-0 and it looked like we were Chicago's little kid brothers getting a healthy dose of titty-twisters and Indian burns. Cecile Benson was lopping off 40-yard runs and Grossman wasn't being pressured into poor throwing decisions! We were a one-dimensional offense playing like a one-dimensional offense and our kicker pulled a make-able 44 yard field goal inside the friendly confines of Qwest Field.</p>

<p>Then somehow something clicked. Bing bang boom we were down the field, Hasselbeck making masterful throws in traffic to heavily guarded receivers. A slipped tackle here, a 3rd down conversion there, and all of a sudden - with our full allotment of receivers on the field for the first time since the first quarter of the first game of the season - we showed that we're once again that potent offense that can score at will against any defense.</p>

<p>Granted, now we can't keep teams guessing. We can't keep them honest by holding seven or eight men in the box and then bulling them over anyway. We've got to finesse them. We've got to dink and dunk them and - when the iron's hot - we've got to pierce their souls with a 20-yard strike down the middle of the field on a post pattern in the endzone.</p>

<p>We can't run the ball anymore and everyone knows it. But we can throw the fuck out of that football and now it's time to start flaunting that ability. And if we can take advantage of this advantage, we just might start to resemble something deserving of playing in Arizona this February.</p>

<p>Highlights:</p>

<p>Some People Call Me Maurice Morris busting through the left side of the line for a 20-yard TD. The Bears D looked mighty soft most of the day.</p>

<p>4th & Inches after two failed attempts to run for one yard, Holmgren FINALLY decides to Play-Action Pass. What happened? The Bears D overcommitted, Marcus Pollard slipped wide open to the right, caught the ball at the first down marker and wasn't stopped until he was 20 yards down field.</p>

<p>The Seahawks kickoff coverage did everything but kick the ball out of bounds rather than risk Devin Hester embarassing us with a TD return. So, what happened when we finally boomed it straight and true? The Bears had their worst post-kickoff field position of the day AND Josh Brown made an inspired open-field tackle of the tamed Hester. That's right, Brown 1, Hester 0.</p>

<p>How about Patrick Kerney earning that bigtime White Defensive End money? He was looking like a pigmently-impaired Reggie White out there in the second half, single-handedly destroying the right side of the Bears' O-line to the tune of three sacks, a forced fumble, and a pass deflection. Don't look now, but that's 5 sacks in the last 4 games. Eat your heart out, Grant Wistrom!</p>

<p>I noticed McNabb went down in the Eagles game yesterday. A certain football team from Seattle will be playing those very same Eagles in two weeks ...</p>

<p>I noticed Carolina is still starting Rumpelstiltskin at quarterback ...</p>

<p>I noticed a certain Kyle Boller ...</p>

<p>Joey Harrington ...</p>

<p>Kurt Warner ...</p>

<p>Fargas!</p>
