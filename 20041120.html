<p> I had a dream last night during my 12 and a half hours of sleep (more sleep than any of YOU bitches on a Friday night I guarantee).</p>

<p>Along with the usual things I dream about - sex with my mother, shoving an infant headfirst into a swimming pool until the bubbles stop, the zombies from the Michael Jackson "Thriller" video breaking into my house - there was one scene that caught my attention.</p>

<p>I was with a group of people; I don't think they were friends. I don't think they were friends because we were about to smoke a j and I was ill at ease the entire time, for it was not my j and I didn't want to fuck up the rotation. I was second in the circle and when I took it, the j suddenly burned way too fast and singed my fingers. I dropped it and the j fucking burned itself out on the blanket it fell upon. The look of disgust among my peers was obvious and I was shunned from the group.</p>

<p>Now, I can take this as a sign that my body's going through some delayed withdrawals. It's been quite a while since I got high, a couple months at least, but even then I was too drunk to enjoy the high. </p>

<p>Or, I can take this as a sign that Mr. Mackey was right all along. "Drugs are bad, mmm kay. Mari-ju-wana's bad."</p>

<p>Or, it could simply mean I need to listen to this little Cheech and Chong number, called "Mexican Americans"</p>

<p>Mexican Americans don't just like to get into gang fights
<br />They like flowers, and music, and white girls named Debbie too</p>

<p>Mexican Americans are named Chata, and Chella, and Chema
<br />And have a son-in-law named Jeff</p>

<p>Mexican Americans don't like to get up early, in the morning, but they have to
<br />So they do it, real slow</p>

<p>Mexican Americans love education, so they go to night school
<br />And take Spanish, and get a B</p>

<p>Mexican Americans love their nanas, and their no-nos, and their nee-naws
<br />And their nee-nos, na-nu na-nu, nee-na, no-no</p>

<p>Mexcian Americans don't like to go to the movies where the dude has to wear contact lenses
<br />To make his blue eyes brown, 'cause don't they make my brown eyes blue!</p>

<p>[Cheech] 
<br />And thats all I got how do you like it </p>

<p>[Chong] 
<br />oh ya thats good </p>

<p>[Cheech] 
<br />Its like a protest tune </p>

<p>[Chong] 
<br />ya I dig that but while you were singing that I wrote another tune </p>

<p>[Cheech] 
<br />oh ya </p>

<p>[Chong] 
<br />its like the same thing only different wanna hear it </p>

<p>[Cheech] 
<br />ya lets hear it </p>

<p>[Chong] 
<br />its more rock n roll </p>

<p>[Cheech] 
<br />alright well get down </p>

<p>[Chong] 
<br />Beaners....Beaners 
<br />i have to work more on the lyrics but its kinda like that </p>

<p>[Cheech] 
<br />ya thats heavy </p>

<p>Current Mood: Red Heads on the O.C.
