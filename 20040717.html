<p> GAAAAAA!</p>

<p>Not all the fucking bubblewrap websites in the WORLD can heal my frustration! ((http://www.viceking.net/bubblewrap.swf))</p>

<p>As a semi-avid writer who dabbles in reading from time to time, I've grown accustomed to reading in small, fast bursts. Stephen King, my drug of choice, eases my mind with a yearly novel (though of the last five years or so, his work has been deteriorating, most likely through his giving up of alcohol as his daily muse). Still, he has persisted through the years to produce a series of novels so compelling, no lack of booze-induced frenzy can tame it. </p>

<p>The Dark Tower.</p>

<p>The first volume, written early in 1970 or so (published MUCH later), started off introducing a gunslinger named Roland on his quest to hunt down the Man in Black.</p>

<p>Almost 15 years later, the next volume was written. "The Drawing of the Three". In this one, he pulls three people from magical doors on a beach from a different world, one much like that of our own real-life world.</p>

<p>From that, bred "The Waste Lands" about three years later. A continuation of their journey to find the Dark Tower, that of which holds up all worlds.</p>

<p>A decade of cliff-hanger insanity followed before it was resolved in about 1997 with "Wizard and Glass"</p>

<p>And, finally, last year, number 5 was released. A month ago, there came number 6. And, in exactly 2 months, according to Amazon.com, the final volume will be released.</p>

<p>The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower.</p>

<p>And with that, in all likelihood, Stephen King will retire from writing. The writing is on the wall. This is his "Lord of the Rings". His ultimate tale. It's a sad state of affairs.</p>

<p>Check them out, they're intense, quality reads. Coming from someone who doesn't read all that much, I have to choose my books wisely. It's worth it, believe me.</p>

<p>Current Mood: Quack
<br />Current Music: Phish - The Squirming Coil</p>
