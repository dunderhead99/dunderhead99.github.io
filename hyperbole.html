Hyperbole (Not "Hyper Bowl")

</h1>

<h6>

<p class="indent">Bask in my grandeur, fear my destructive wrath.  The deafening magnitude of my voice, sans artificial amplification, has shaken even the tallest buildings.  I possess the ability to turn water into wine and lead into gold.  I expertly sanitize telephone poles, I fight wild dogs for loose scraps of meat.  I race cars blindfolded and regain consciousness in the fetal position.  I steal national landmarks and sell them at flea markets.  </p>
<p class="indent">I grow Florida oranges in California orchards.  My soothing, melodic symphonies garner praise from the citizens in Oman.  I irritate the animals in the Australian Outback, I feast on the suffering of despondent politicians.  I construct cells for minimum security prisons.  I have revived dead lawnmower motors.</p>
<p class="indent">I deliver mail to the homeless.  My syndicated comic strips delight as well as horrify.  I write jokes for award ceremonies while I sleep.  I secure cargo for cross-country skiers.  I demand attention, I disrespect royalty.  On lunch breaks, I deliver babies for surrogate mothers.  I have grown corn in the Sahara desert.  Generally, I hibernate during the summer.  </p>
<p class="indent">I have played guitar with Jimi Hendrix.  Instead of working, I dive for sunken treasure, without the aid of an oxygen tank.  I pitch forks and water skis.  My beard has been known to frighten the elderly.  I can communicate with the dead, but it occurred to me that they have nothing new to say.  My endorsement enrages the Establishment.  </p>

<p class="indent">Of course, it should be no surprise that I am still single.</p>
