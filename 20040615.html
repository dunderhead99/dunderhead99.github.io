<p> So, in all seriousness, if Britney Spears did porn, do you think that would be the most purchased magazine of all time? I bet it would have done better about a year or two ago. Maybe right around when the Toxic video was released, because we're already so close to seeing the whole package by that point. You know, I've never owned any print porno before, but I must admit I'd be tempted. Even though it's rumored that Britney has cellulite up the ass (pardon the pun). That's why air has brushes.</p>

<p>You know what sucks very much about summer? Right now, I've got five people on my AIM. That's not counting myself and Smarterchild (God, WHY do I still have that???). Oh, now it's down to four. And they're all idle, which I should be too, but, you know. Shit happens.</p>
