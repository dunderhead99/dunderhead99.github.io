<p>Oh no, Schoolyard Heroes, I vomit out my heart for YOU.
<br />]
<br />The opportunity for me to hit the ol' snooze button is plenty rare simply because I'm so anally retentive and such a worrywort about oversleeping or the clock malfunctioning or something; really, the only time it ever gets hit for realsies is when I'm too out-of-it to realize what I'm doing could be detrimental to my employment.
<br />]
<br />This morning, not only was I out-of-it, not only did I hit the snooze, but I actually managed to sleep THROUGH the snooze portion of my alarm's cycle, only to finally wake up at 6:41am freaking out, thinking I'd slept in too late even though I still had a solid two hours to get to work.
<br />]
<br />It should be needless to say that I didn't shower this morning, or eat breakfast; but I did manage to brush my teeth. All about those moral victories.
<br />]
<br />I'm gonna need my job to be extraspecial nice to me today, because I'm rolling in here on three hours of sleep (having gotten home just a skosh after 3am, then having the bright idea of trying to sober up a bit by watching a half hour's worth of Twin Peaks; I couldn't imagine a more frightening way to sober up). I'm lookin' happily deranged this morning because I spent the better portion of last night drinking beers and watching live music at Pianos. Specifically, the Schoolyard Heroes, Seattle band extraordinaire. All my sanity and wits have vanished long ago, my friends.
<br />]
<br />And that pile of blood by my feet, that's what's left of my eardrums. I really should mop that up pretty soon.
<br />]
<br />I. Love. This. Band. That's all that needs to be said. I know for a fact - a 75% fact - that they played the new song that's featured on their MySpace page. Honestly though, it was tough to tell; I really only recognized a couple songs but that's through no lack of me listening to their first two albums. It was just really hard to hear in there. Not that I'm one to pay attention to lyrics in general, but every once in a while I DID pick up on a familiar sounding melody, so that was cool.
<br />]
<br />You should've seen me, I was up at the very front of the crowd - standing right in front of the bass player, I think his name is Jonah, who was standing stage-right of the lead singer, I think her name is Ryann - jumping up and down with every song, giving the devil horns with every hard-rocking note, coming out of that oh-so-short set pretty much drenched in sweat when it was all done. Seriously though, it felt like they were on there for ten, fifteen minutes tops, even though they were supposedly on there for 45 minutes to an hour.
<br />]
<br />There was a young lady next to me who was rocking just about as hard as I was, so naturally I thought she was either a Seattle-transplant like myself or just somehow a really big Schoolyard Heroes fan. Turns out neither was the case, as this was her first time seeing the group, but she came away highly impressed. Anyway, I exchanged pleasantries with the bass player for a second before they had to take down the stage for the following band, who I didn't stick around to see.
<br />]
<br />I didn't get there until nearly 11:00 and they didn't go on until after midnight, and it was a LONG time before I managed to get home. I finished a 6-pack of Red Stripe at home beforehand, had three or four cans of PBR at the bar, with a shot of whiskey on top of that, and today I'm sufficiently ravaged. You should hear me talk; I sound like I just spent three and a half hours at a Husky game. I haven't yelled that hard or made that big an ass of myself in a long time; it was awesome.
<br />]
<br />Of course, that's because the Schoolyard Heroes are awesome. I'd suffer these crappy work days of three hours' sleep all the time for this band. Nothing would please me more than to see them hit it big, get some national or international acclaim, just so I can say I knew them when they used to play El Corazón.
<br />]
<br />Well, I suppose a decent roll in the hay with the lead singer might please me more, but that's neither here nor there. I just naturally assume she's who my dream girl would be; looking the way she does while still able to belt out those lyrics and sit on my face at the same time. Just give me that and a Taco Del Mar burrito in each hand and you can kill me then and there.</p>
