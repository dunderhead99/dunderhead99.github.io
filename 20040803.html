<p> So, you know, if I get screwed because I blew off my old job and it turns out I don't get this new one, maybe I can STILL be the next generation's Cliff Clavin . . . living in his mother's house, going to a bar every night, and STILL not getting any. </p>

<p>{{What do you say to a girl with two black eyes?</p>

<p>Nothing, you've done told her twice}}</p>


<p>OK, so here's the plan. I'm gonna get a hot novel published by 25, make shit-loads of money and then go into seclusion. Once there, I'll let every addiction I can think of consume my being. Alcohol, cigarettes, weed, blow, COFFEE even, and completely rot my insides. I'll be a shrivelled, shiverring, red-eyed recluse with almost no ties to the outside world whatsoever. And, the world will find my decomposed corpse in the woods somewhere with a needle in my vein and a totally righteous final work pinned to my body at the age of 27. Being the most famous, most worthless washout the literary world has ever seen; leaving a SPECTACULAR corpse will be my gift to society. </p>

<p>Just so long as I don't bloat up like Jim Morrison, dying in a bathtub in France.</p>

<p>All I need is some hippie-artsy-fart chick by my side, revelling in my bohemian ways, to tell my tale. With red hair, possibly from Europe, but NOT from Ireland.</p>

<p>Of course, she'll have to be someone who's lived in the Pacific Northwest and has the good sense to want to move away; who can't understand why Steve Buscemi isn't a bigger star; who drinks and smokes and fucks like I do then takes care of me afterward; who's read The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test and wants desperately to be a Merry Prankster in another life; who appreciates the intricities to a dozen different live versions of Jimi Hendrix performing "Red House"; AND has good lookin' sandal feet, because where I'm going, you DON'T fucking wear shoes!</p>

<p>Current Mood: Lungs craftily coated
<br />Current Music: Smashing Pumpkins - The End Is The Beginning Is The End</p>
