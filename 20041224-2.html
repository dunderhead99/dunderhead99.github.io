<p> Something tells me it's a better idea to NOT put the moves on the daughter of my mom's boyfriend.</p>

<p>Especially when ... evidently she went to my high school. And graduated two years before I did. Which means she's two years older than me. And looks like she's about ten years older than me. I tell you, the ravages of smoking will kill you. Then again, genetics don't help you out much either, evidently.</p>

<p>However, it's hard to forget an ass ... no. That's just the Christmas Presents Euphoria talking. And, about a half dozen mixed drinks. I'm telling you, the hard-A goggles I've got going right now, dying cancer patients would look hot right now. Seriously, getting that close-parking sticker. That means I'm first in line to get that contraceptive AND first in line for Bingo. Geriatrics watch out.</p>

<p>OK, so I'm looking at this girl who went to my school, in my year book. A Junior when I was a Freshman. She even got a quote in the book. You know what I got? A nice "Fuck You" wrapped in a thoughtful "Suck My Asshole" with the most tasteful "Kiss My Grits" ribbon on top. I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm giving this girl about a six normally, but at the moment, I wouldn't throw her out of bed. Is that wrong? I guess not, especially since at the moment my "Bed" is the floor with a blanket and a pillow. Basically, I'm saying I wouldn't stop this chick from sleeping on the floor if I could help it. Come on, am I a catch or what? Dude, when I move out, you better believe I'm gonna be mackin' on all the fly honeys. My milkshake brings all the girls to the yard.</p>
