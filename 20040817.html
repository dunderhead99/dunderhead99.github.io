<p> So, I'm at a party, and I meet a pirate. How often do you meet a pirate at a party, you know? So, I'm curious, so I go up and talk to the pirate. You know, he's got the peg leg, the hook, the eyepatch, the parrot, the whole garb. So I ask him, "How'd you get the wooden leg?"</p>

<p>And he tells me, "You know how you board a ship and you throw the hooks over to hook the ships together to make the ships easier to board? Well, I got a little anxious. And, well I tried to jump over to the ship and I missed and, well, I got my leg caught in between." So, I was like, well that's cool, so I asked him about the hook.</p>

<p>The pirate said, "Well, the guy was gonna shoot me with a musket, but I blocked it with my hand. And, well, it blew off my hand."</p>

<p>I said, "Oh, well, that sucks."</p>

<p>Later on, I asked him, "So, Pirate man, how'd you get the eye patch?"</p>

<p>The pirate said, "You know, I was sittin' on the beach one day, laying in the sun, and a bird shat in my eye."</p>

<p>And I said, "Huh, that's kinda funny, because, you know, birdshit doesn't take out your eye."</p>

<p>And the pirate said, "Well ... that was the first day I had the hook."</p>

<p>Current Mood: Pirate pisses on my face
<br />Current Music: Where'd you get the Canadian Tuxedo?</p>
