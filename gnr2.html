Nice Boys Don't Play Rock N' Fuckin' Roll.

<p>Today is officially August 2, 2007.</p>

<p>In December of last year, Axl Rose stated that work was in "Post-Production" on the album "Chinese Democracy" - a Guns N' Roses legend akin to Sasquatch, UFOs, and Jessica Simpson's Certificate Of Literacy: each believed by many nutbags to exist, though the public at large has yet to see any concrete proof. A tentative release date was set for March 6, 2007.</p>

<p>Today is officially August 2, 2007.</p>

<p>On May 5, 2006, Axl stated that the album would be out "by the end of the year."</p>

<p>Today is officially August 2, 2007.</p>

<p>The last studio album released by Guns N' Roses hit record stores on November 23, 1993; it was an album of cover songs. Until that point, the band had been on a world tour for 28 straight months, so obviously we can't hold it against them that they'd release a covers album. That same year, Axl began writing new material for what would eventually, hypothetically, become "Chinese Democracy."</p>

<p>Today is officially August 2, 2007.</p>

<p>People have called Axl Rose many things - racist, homophobe, megalomaniac, bi-polar, hermit, greedy fuckhead, pussy, big-mouth jackass - but what gets bandied about more lately is "Perfectionist." 14 years working on one album, yeah, I can see that. But, I'll do you one better. He's completely lost his sense of who he is. When Guns N' Roses first started out in the mid-80s, Axl had the cocky swagger to demand $75,000 upfront from the Geffen label - before they'd recorded a fucking note of music for them. The band went into the studio with all their addictions firmly in place and proceeded to bang out the greatest-selling debut album of all time ("Appetite For Destruction").</p>

<p>You want to know how badass Axl Rose is? On the album's closer - Rocket Queen - he recorded himself having sex with the drummer's girlfriend and placed her orgasmic screams over a guitar solo in the middle of the 6+ minute tune. Have you ever heard of that EVER? That takes a set of fuckin' balls, let me tell you. The album has gone on to sell over 25 million copies worldwide.</p>

<p>Now? Axl is so scared of releasing the new album that he's spending way way WAY more time than is required, fine-tuning an album that - when it finally sees the light of day - will ultimately be a disappointment anyway. Because, when you think of somebody taking 14 years to create a rock album, you'd assume that it's going to be the greatest thing since Sgt. Pepper. And obviously it won't be! I'd bet every last dime I had that Chinese Democracy will go down as the fifth best studio album out of the five that Guns N' Roses has released.</p>

<p>Today is officially August 2, 2007, and the pressure is only getting higher for Axl. The longer he waits, the greater the disappointment, and ultimately the more devastated he'll finally be once the results are in. Critics who've crucified him for his behavior in the past - most notably firing everyone else from the original band lineup - will tear into the new album with the vigor of a carnivore possessed. Hardcore fans will eat it up with salivating glands. And everybody else - many of which made up the bulk of the fanbase worldwide - will greet Chinese Democracy with a collective, "Guns ... huh? Oh yeah, that Sweet Child O' Mine band ... yeah, I don't think so."</p>
