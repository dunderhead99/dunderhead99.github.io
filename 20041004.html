<p> Here's the plan, tonight I watch Monday Night Football. Kansas City is at Baltimore. If the Chefs win, I win a hundred bucks. Simple as that.</p>

<p>Now, if they DON'T win, then I'm gonna come back on here and rip every team that fucked me over this week a new asshole.</p>

<p>Everyone, go watch Super Size Me and then try to eat fast food. Seriously, I think I've lost all my McDesire to eat that shit ever again. We played a drinking game last night where we drank once whenever anyone said Super Size and twice when they said the whole thing "Super Size Me"</p>

<p>We drank, also, whenever anyone on the documentary drank; and whenever the guy took a bite from a sandwich (burger, fish burger, egg mcmuffin).</p>

<p>Needless to say, I forget how the movie ends. I think he died or something.</p>

<p>Also, fucking Curtis Conway cost me big time in that shitty 49er game. I said he wouldn't catch any more than 4 balls. He had zero at halftime, but ended the game with like 7. Had to shotgun two fucking beers because of that ass! Then, another later on when I lost back to back bumper pool games! But, you know, I was hopped up on the 40 I bought.</p>

<p>Current Mood: Please don't suck KC! PLEASE
<br />Current Music: And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead - Another Morning Stoner</p>
