It's like the worst movie ever made.

<p> Like anyone could even know that!</p>

<p>OK, so Saw isn't the worst movie ever made. In fact, it's got quite the compelling story. A few problems, though. Don't much care for the Scooby Doo ending (Wayne's World did it much better). The over-acting on the part of the doctor . . . you know, if you were planning on renting the movie, you might want to skip down a few paragraphs. But, seriously, the dude who plays the doctor, just watch whenever he gets enraged. I don't care much for the flashbacks. It's just poor writing technique when the character goes, "Oh, I finally remember what happened to me . . ." and then it goes into the corresponding flashback. Just find a more creative way to say what it is you said there; I'm not saying do exactly what a film like Memento did, but think of SOMETHING.</p>

<p>Save the Scooby Doo part, I still like the way the movie finishes off. But, you KNOW they were forced by the production company to make some edits. I bet, in the original version, there were some grizzley parts. I mean, these are first-time screenwriters/directors; there's just no way they saw their original vision through to fruition.</p>

<p>As far as "scary" movies go, and this movie wasn't scary except for this one part ... and I'd like to add that I WAS high for this movie, so really, a bouquet of posies should've been scary, I'd rate this above the shit like Jeepers Creepers, ... hmm, damndest thing, can't seem to think of any other shitty horror flicks in the same vein, but you catch my drift. Saw is one of these movies that's trying to be like Seven, or even those Hannibal movies. That's really what you've got going for you here. It's Hannibal Lecter with morals/ideology. </p>

<p>Now, if you want a good movie that's kinda sorta not really scary, watch Frailty. Borrow it from me if you have to. It's fucking awesome. Frailty makes Saw look like Uncle Rico throwing the football for an hour and 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Pray for me, I might actually have to do real, actual work today. But, I swear, I'm getting in as many naps as possible during work on Friday to get ready for the Rockstar Party. I hope I'll have time to practice my dance moves ... but I swear that's all the hints you get!!!</p>

<p>No, I'm only playin'. I'll give out crappy little hints as the week goes on and we'll just have to see if anyone can guess</p>

<p>Current Mood: Ugh, this is like the fiftieth Beatles song of the Top 500, ENOUGH ALREADY
<br />Current Music: Prince - Kiss</p>

<br />Steve,</p>

<p>First off, the RockStar party. There are rumors you spent $300 on a costume. Now, some people are saying Jimmi Hendrix, just because you'd pull off the puke covered scarf wonderfully, but my gut tells me you blew a hell of a lot of money on an overdone Jack Black costume. I mean, you could pass as him anyday of the week but this is a PARTY. but now to my real point... </p>

<p>Is there a ESPN Page 2 Curse? First Ralph Wiley dies, now the (insert superlative) Hunter S. Thompson literally bites the bullet? Is this the SI Cover Curse for writers? I was going to tell you that Bill Simmons is having a contest for becoming his new intern (you just have to email him in 400 words or less why you should be), but I'm having second thoughts. It sounds more like a death sentence than an awesome opportunity to surf the web and opine to the masses. Any takers for who is the next to go??? Eric Neel? the Sports Guy?

<br />Argh, Matt. Jimmi? Oh man, I'm hoping that's just due to some semen getting lodged under the M key in your keyboard ...</p>

<p>And, really, I'm pretty sure I have everything I need in my closet for J.B. Had I had a couple months to prepare, I could've gotten the beard grown and the hair ... well, I'm sure there are modestly priced wig shops. </p>
