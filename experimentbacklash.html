                        a preasant tense story in
                        the truest sense of the
                        word...a real time story
                        that was taking place  on
                        the page while
                        simulatneously taking
                        place in real life.  Talk
                        about creative
                        non-fiction.  The first
                        part of his story where
                        "Steven" is sitting at
                        his desk smirking, while
                        the rest of the class
                        realizes they have been
                        had.  It was happening on
                        paper and in reality. 
                        This story was written
                        for a specific audience
                        and could only have it's
                        effect on this audience
                        at this time.  It was
                        meant for the workshop. 
                        It is a totally different
                        form of writing or
                        entertainment or art.  It
                        makes me wonder about the
                        goal of stories or art in
                        general.  Is it to get
                        published as R. said
                        today?  Yes, that's part
                        of it.  But the real goal
                        is to move people right? 
                        To make people feel
                        something or see
                        something.  Steven's
                        story created all the
                        stuff we love about
                        movie! s and
                        stories(art)... anger,
                        frustration,
                        humiliation,confusion,
                        humor, etc. The
                        difference is we couldn't
                        experience these emotions
                        from the somewhat
                        detached perspective of
                        reader/observer...a
                        rubber necker watching
                        the carnage of an auto
                        wreck from the safety of
                        our car.  We were the
                        carnage. It created these
                        feelings in us and
                        totally involved us in
                        the most personal way
                        didn't it?  I think
                        so...at least right now. 
                        Am I giving him too much
                        credit?  I don't think
                        so.  As his title implies
                        "Man these Stories Write
                        Themselves" this story
                        was writing itself today
                        in class as we were
                        experiencing it.  Our
                        initial reading of the
                        story before class was
                        only the start, we had to
                        get to the work shop for
                        it to really climax and
                        reveal itself.  It was
                        written specifically for
                        us not for some
                        publisher.  Again, I
                        don't mean to say that I
                        beleive it is wrong to
                        want to get published at
                        all, that's ! how you get
                        your story out there...I
                        want my stories
                        published!  It is a huge
                        goal and completely
                        necessary...but that is
                        only a small part of the
                        larger goal one has as
                        writer. Right? I am going
                        to bet that other people
                        besides me were moved
                        enough to email you about
                        today.  Am I totally
                        ridiculous?  Maybe he
                        didn't intend any of this
                        and I am just playing
                        right into his
                        hands...trying to be a
                        deep thinker, expertly
                        reading between the lines
                        while he sits there
                        laughing at me.</p>

<p>I can respect experimentation. If not for experimentation, art might
become fairly stagnant. BUT. An artist, when he or she is experimenting,
should not be laughing AT his or her audience. They should be laughing
with them, if they are laughing at all. Otherwise that person is no artist
at all, but a prankster.

<p>Dear all,</p>

<p>Just a brief response: I believe we asked Stephen what his goal was, and he
shrugged his shoulders. T.P.N. outright asked that question and the response from
the author was agreement that not a whole lot of thought went into the goal
except chaos. I think that this particular story failed to achieve anything more
than annoyance on part of the class. If the point of discussing this further is
to find some value in Stephen's story, the discussion is pointless. To call
Stephen's story 'art' is wrong. Most artists will agree that simple vandalism or
name-calling, or any other tactic to incite anger or an emotional response isn't
art, not even performance art. It doesn't require much thought or originality to
pull a silly prank, not matter how much time was spent to write all the various
stories (which I believe T. even pointed out, weren't that well written). If
we want to discuss how a story could accomplish the goals that J.L.R. is
suggesting, I'd only be interested in doing th!
<br />at.</p>

<p>Thanks,

<p>Hi Everyone,

<br />So I've been thinking about Steven's story (stories) quite a bit the last couple
of days. I'd like to throw some more thoughts out, in case anyone has their own
thoughts to add.
<br />Mainly, it has got me to thinking about what our obligations are as writers.
Especially when that concerns any obligation we have to readers. It could very
well be the case that Steven's intention with the story was for us all to have a
laugh. Of course we know it wasn't recieved that way. I think for most of us, we
felt like our time and energy had been wasted. 
<br />It becomes tricky though. I think as writers we have to be very aware of the
effect our writing will have on others. John Gardner says (in The Art of
Fiction) something to the effect of, when we write, we should write as if
someone on the verge of suicide will be reading our work. It could potentially
have very drastic consequences. That may be a little egotistical, but it's a
good point. Fiction can have a big effect on people, as we experienced the other
day. I think it's our job as writers to keep this in mind. It doesn't mean we
should change anything to accomodate our readers, necessarily. I think it means
that we have the very tricky job of trying to foresee the effect our writing
will have. What happened the other day pissed a lot of us off. But it shows that
we have an obligation to readers, to write the best fiction we can and not play
tricks on people. 
<br />This is a long one, and I'm sorry if I've rambled a bit. But I would like to see
what other people's thoughts are on all of this. 
<br />See you all monday,
<br />J.</p>

<br />Subject: Re: steven's story</p>

<p>hELLO,</p>

<p>My thoughts on this one are that, yes, we do have an obligation to readers
to write the best fiction we can, but as writers, I believe that is a
given.  I think that, first and foremost, we write for ourselves, with
(hopefully) the intention of creating something meaningful that will touch
other people.  I think Steven's intention was to create an extravagant
prank, it was something he obviously spent some amount of time on with
writing several different versions of the story.  I'm not so sure he
deserves as much credit as he's starting to be given for creating a
real-time story, however.  The audience = us, and we're an audience that
is going to give this story thorough thought and energy as the course
format demands.  Therefore, I can't help but see this as an unfair satire
because most people in this class are (and I'm sure did, as they've done
on every story) going to give their best effort to offer their time and
thoughts on a story, then to show up, and find that their efforts were for
nothing other than someone's idea of a joke--which I will hold was the
primary motivation of this since Steven didn't make any
validation for why he did this, and therefore I don't think he deserves
this much pondering over what the supreme artistic statement is, because I
don't think there is one.</p>

<p>I think that, if we are going to have this discussion, we should take what happened on Wed. out of the equation. Which is why I changed the subject line on this e-mail.</p>

<p>That said, here's my 2 cents:
<br />1) Stories that play a trick on the reader never serve the reader, they just
serve the writer.</p>

<p>2) Bad writing serves the writer.
<br />Good writing entertains the reader. GREAT writing elevates the reader.</p>

<p>Great writing lets us experience the world in a whole new way - good or bad.
<br />It widens our focus. It also probably entertains us - in some way - along
the way.</p>

<p>I really do feel that there is a certain level of not just quality we are
expected to produce in this class, but also a level of professionalism.  I don't
think Wednesday reflected that, and I agree with what J.H.C. has stated.  I don't
think tricks are ever truly designed to serve the reader because there is a
profound difference between a plot twist and a plain old trick.  Additionally, I
think what J.L.R. said was very true.  Writing should have some kind of
importance that goes along with it, otherwise it's just stuff taking up space.
There are many, many people in the world who can write nice stuff, or tricky
stuff, but it takes something bigger, more important, to write great stuff.  I
thought we were striving to reach some of that great stuff over everything else.
To throw out another agreement, D.K. is right.  Wednesday's story wasn't
designed as some deep metaphysical dissection of the modern fiction, it was a
joke.  I think that's all that can be said about it.!</p>

<br />Subject: Re:  steven's story</p>

<p>484 Comrades:</p>

<p>In general response to the e-mail class discussion of Steven's workshop, I think
that J.L.R., bless your heart, *is* giving far too much credit to this event as a
literary/social experiment.  I thought that Steven's story was an expertly
executed prank, and a much more original way to avoid criticism in a workshop
than by simply not showing up for class.  I personally did not feel that my time
had been "wasted" in critiquing his work, because I had to write a critique for
that day regardless, and I mainly felt disappointment that I could not praise
the sentence-level writing of the story I read in a workshop setting.  I do not
know what the two other stories he wrote were like, but the one I read - while
slight in tone for its number of pages - held a great deal of potential as a
quirky story that with some revision could have had an amount of depth.  There
was much to appreciate in the story I read, and it is a shame that that was not
able to be discussed on Wednesday, I thin!
<br />k the author could have received some valuable feedback.</p>

<p>While the idea of "present-tense" literature is intriguing, I feel that Steven's
stories can only be discussed in the context of performance art or social
experiment.  This prank used literature as its medium but gave the same
immediate and transitory effect as wrapping a bridge in plastic under cover of
night - it's interesting, and causes people to look at the commonplace in a new
light, but its true "meaning" is always going to be open to interpretation.  At
heart, it has nothing to do with plastic, or bridges, or writing, but uses these
things to make a completely removed statement.  The fact that we are in a
writing class, prepared to analyze writing, leaves us at a loss as to what to
make of this trick, which uses writing to examine something else.  It was
different, it gives us all a good story to tell people about writing workshops,
and it's over.  I suppose we can all muse over what lasting significance this
event has, but as of now I'm clueless.</p>

<p>I am, however, very interested in J.L.R.'s question on the obligation of writers
to their readers.  We seemed to have trouble in class Wednesday putting our
fingers on what exactly a single-question topic on the subject of morality in
writing would be, but what I "heard" in our efforts was the question of
responsibility - do we have any as writers?  J.L.R. included in his e-mail a
quote about how one should assume their writing is being read by someone on the
verge of suicide, which seems a vivid example of this question.</p>

<p>Personally, I feel that the writer has no moral responsibility to the reader
besides providing a work that is spelled correctly and has its pages in the
correct order.  I say this because I assume that the definition of "morality" in
fiction is a directive to provide values and hope in all works of writing, which
I can safely say is not the case in many of the pieces of literature we have
read throughout our lives.  If the writer has any responsibility, it is to
convey their meaning clearly and powerfully.  The writer should have enough
respect for the reader to assume that his/her words are not going to be treated
as Gospel.</p>

<p>This reminds me of last year's fracas with author Jonathan Franzan and his novel
"The Corrections".  His novel was chosen for Oprah's Book Club, and he publicly
disdained her reading audience, resulting in him not appearing on her show.
Regardless of how you may feel about Oprah and her Book Club, this act struck me
as supremely arrogant, the thought that a writer should be able to "choose"
his/her audience.  To me, it seemed he was saying, "You live in the city, so you
can read my book; you all are in the suburbs, so you wouldn't understand it".
This illustrates why I think that the writer really has no responsibility to the
reader.  The writer should write what he wants to say in the best way he can say
it, and hope that his work falls into the hands of someone who identifies with
it.  Who is to say who will be affected by one's work?  One can only make sure
that what is on the page reflects what one wants to say, and hope that it
benefits someone, somewhere.</p>

<p>In conclusion, and to tie this back to Steven's story, I think that it is a
personal judgment call as to how much time one spends on any given piece of
writing.  Many years ago I was of the mind, "I likes what I likes and I dismiss
what I don't".  I have lately gone somewhat far in the other direction to
examine those works I don't immediately have an affinity for, say, oh, Lorrie
Moore's stories.  I now have an almost masochistic compulsion to examine what in
a piece offended me, and try to see what the author was trying to convey, and
try to figure out why it affected me negatively.  Did it challenge my long-held
vision of the world?  Did it make me, for a half-hour, part of a world I find
distasteful?  Is there *anything* I can appreciate in a story I dislike, and can
I see how maybe it might have value for someone else?</p>

<p>These questions are difficult to pose for Steven's workshop since it was such a
small, immediate event.  The notions of poking fun at the "seriousness" of
literary criticism are interesting, but I wonder how much of that was the intent
of this prank.  I think that in writing, one should reflect one's own vision and
leave it up to the reader to either identify with that or put the book down.
You can only control yourself, and as unfortunate as that is for potential
suicides around the world, they are not your responsibility.  Every piece of
writing is one person's attempt to evoke universal truths, it is up to you as a
reader to either agree or disagree.</p>

<p>Sorry this is so long and yes, I *do* have a Chaucer final paper to write that
I'm procrastinating on.</p>

list. Whether we want to talk about the story from wednesday, or ignore it, we
all seem to have quite a lot to talk about. I know I do. And I find it fairly
comical. 
<br />Cheers,
<br />Have a good weekend y'all,
<br />J.</p>

<p>      Hi All,</p>

<p>      Yes, it would be nice to hear from Steven.  I want to thank
      both J.L.R. and Steven for getting this discussion started
      because it has been an opportunity for many people in the
      class to fortify and express their view of the writer's role
      and obligation, or lack there of, to his or her audience. 
      (Perhaps this is the fiction and morality discussion
      requested by J.L.R.) The postings have been eloquent, and I
      found myself agreeing with much of what was said, especially
      those that saw Steven's story experiment as an elaborate
      prank. That being said, I want to say that I believe that
      Steven conducted this truly original prank in the spirit good
      fun and had no intention to harm or hurt. I want to
      acknowledge that he's in a bit of a difficult position now,
      perhaps more so than he might have anticipated, and I hope he
      will finish his last week in the class, knowing that he is
      welcome and knowing that he has ignited an interesting
      discussion in the class.  Sometimes! , the repercussions of a
      story or an act become more interesting than the thing
      itself!</p>

<p>      Because the only real loss was Steven's, who lost the
      opportunity to be workshopped, I must conclude that while I
      fail to see the experiment as a "real time" story, no harm
      has been done either.</p>

<p>      Steven? Anything?</p>

<p>      T.</p>

<p>Yes.  I'll respond between tonight and Sunday evening, whenever I have the time
to properly articulate a response.  </p>

<p>I'll be in class this week, don't worry about me.</p>

<br />Subject: Re:  steven's story</p>

<p>To the class:  (this is going to be a bit long; warning in advance)</p>

<p>I'd like to start this off with some written quotes that say a lot about me
right now.  I'm not going to include names, because these came from written
responses and I don't know if the writers want their names shared.</p>

<p>"Do readers enjoy being tricked at the end of a story?  Not especially."</p>

<p>"But then again, you probably don't care about the average reader, so whatever."</p>

<p>"There is more going on in the writer's mind than there is on the page."</p>

<p>"There is no reason to understand it as more than a literary exercise written to
satisfy a whim or curiosity of the writer."</p>

<p>"What is the point?  Why was it written?"</p>

<p>I commend you for your foresight.  You didn't even have to attend the workshop
to understand much of what I have to think.  </p>

<p>After those first three emails, I was all ready to blast off on every minute
point discussed.  I was backed into a corner, what can I say?  After the last
seven or eight, though, I have been nothing but entertained.  I love receiving
my hate mail!  </p>

<p>Let me just try to clarify some things, here.  (While trying not to sound
egotistical, though realizing that people will feel how they feel regardless) I
ended up writing five stories.  No, I don't think they're very great
individually.  If you read them all together, in order, it has the potential to
work as a really long short story.  The only problem:  they all return to the
same place to start each one.  This is for two reasons:  1) to make the first
pages on each story the same for the workshop; 2) to show that no matter how
good we think we are, we can always fall into the same traps over and over in
our writing.  Think of the movie Groundhog Day.  You strive to better yourselves
in your writing, but inevitably, most of the time, you'll find yourself in the
same spot, writing the same way, at the inception of every story.  </p>

<p>There is a running theme throughout the stories, though it can be perceived as
being hidden or non-existent, especially since you couldn't read them all.
Besides, it's more of a personal theme that I don't know if I portrayed well
enough for others to get if they don't know me.  Mostly, it is about the writing
process and how I let my imagination run wild (that's where I got the title
from).  Just taking a simple idea, something in real life, and imagining it
happening to you.  How would you react?  How would you want yourself to react?
Yes, very juvenile - I've been exercising this since my childhood, imagining
running away or whatnot.  In deeper, it's about some of my greatest fears, and
it all comes back to writing badly/failing as a writer (which is probably
working its way through me right now).</p>

<p>No, I don't usually consider the obligation to the reader.  I write for myself.
No, that may not pay the bills, but if I didn't write with myself as the target
audience, then I wouldn't have the passion that I have for writing.  If I wanted
to be a mindless writing drone, I would be in journalism class right now
learning how to fit as much information into as little space as possible while
trying to appeal to the broadest audience I can muster, instead of a creative
writing workshop - where the goal is to take a chance.  To create something
unique.  If nothing else, you have to admit that I did both of those things,
regardless of how successful you feel I was in my statement.  Or how meaningless
you feel that statement was.  </p>

<p>So, what was the point?  I'm going to try to answer that, but most of you
already have your own conclusions.  No matter what I say, once people have ideas
implanted into their minds, nothing I can say will change that.  But, isn't that
really the point?  For you to draw your own conclusions?  More than anything, I
hate spelling things out for people.  One of my biggest criticisms is that my
stories can be too confusing.  I think that may, in part, be a result of my
inability to articulate everything that I have in my head onto the written page.
Maybe it's because I rushed through these, writing four stories in two days,
then spending another week and a half writing the last one and revising the
other four.  However, I intend for a lot of my ambiguity that I create.  I don't
really want you to understand what I have in my head, so you can draw your own
conclusions.  I know that you all love to closely, critically analyze stories,
so it drives you crazy when the author doesn'!
<br />t let you understand everything that's going on.  For many of you, you like to
have everything wrapped up.  You want to know what happened so you can wrap your
minds around it and provide a decent response.  In all honesty, I don't want to
answer the question posed at the beginning of this paragraph, because I'd find
it much more entertaining to let you all ponder it.  </p>

<p>My point:  to write something bigger.  I had the urge to write a lot at the
beginning of this quarter.  I wanted to do something different, to shake up the
workshop process.  I wanted to entertain myself.  I wanted to mess with you so I
could get a laugh.  I hadn't anticipated the response I got, though I
anticipated many, many others.  In the end, I believe that any response is
better than no response at all.  When I told my friends and family what I was
doing, I got such a positive response, I only assumed that I would get a similar
response from the students of the class at least.  I'm not too concerned,
though.  I find it all endlessly fascinating.  </p>

<p>As I read through the emails, I wondered why people hadn't considered that maybe
I was too afraid of criticism, so I decided to do this.  Well, I'm not afraid of
criticism.  I'm my biggest critic and I feel that I have to be.  We've already
discussed this, not everything in workshops will work for the writer.  Just
"take it under advisement" and move on.  So, I decided to take the entire
workshop "under advisement," to see if I could survive on my own.  I'll have to
do this when I graduate anyway.  I have to look at my work objectively and
criticize accordingly.  Last quarter, I sat and listened to the workshop, took
thorough notes, pondered my story for two solid weeks, then ended up doing my
own thing, scrapping much of my previous story and thus making the workshop
useless.  Maybe it made me think, but I'm under the opinion that my deadline
makes me think harder.</p>

<p>In closing, I'd like to say that, in my story, I never called myself
"brilliant," nor did I say that I was a better writer than any of you.  If
you're that insecure that you feel that the stories are talking to you and
making fun of you, then I'm sorry.  That's not my problem.  I'd like to address
one of you right here, though I won't mention your name.  No, you shouldn't have
to feel that your life is threatened, nor should you "call the cops."  I can
play Smart-Ass too, you see.  If you do feel frightened by my story, then
haven't I written one piece of vivid fiction?  Believe me, other people have
seen my writing as "a cry for help," and I'm still here.  So there!</p>

<p>So, I don't exactly know how "welcome" I'm going to be, but I'm sure I'll be in
class tomorrow.  I'd like to thank those of you who have expressed support for
me.  It is much appreciated.  To those of you who don't, well, then I leave you
with this thought:  you'll most-likely get a better grade than me in this class
anyway.  I know that's what's most important to some of you, just like those
"royalties" right?</p>

<p>Thanks for letting us in on some of what you were thinking on this,
Steven.  I'd like to make yours the last word on this, as I think we've
heard a full spectrum of opinions now.</p>

<br />Subject: not directly about your story</p>

<p>Hey, I was thinking of you this weekend. I'm reading a book I think you
(might) enjoy, though I'm not to the end yet and I'm having to wade in
places, so I can't give it my FULL endorsement. Still, where I am in it
made me think it might be something you'd be interested in.</p>

 
<p>The book is called "The Magus" and is by John Fowles (wrote "French
Lieutenant's Woman"). The entire thing is about this elaborate experiment
a wealthy guy living on an island in Greece plays. He sort of casts these
people in a real life play (without them knowing it) then keeps
manipulating the world around them so as to keep changing the outcome,
experiment, etc. It's kinda bizarre and I can't decide what the guy is
trying to get out of it, but it's got me intrigued. If you pick it up
commit to wading through about the first 1/3 - 1/2 of the book. It gets
going after that.</p>
 
<p>Cheers.
<br />J.</p>
