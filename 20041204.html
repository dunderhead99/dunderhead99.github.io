<p> I'm here with a review of the new Radiohead DVD entitled "The Most Gigantic Lying Mouth of all Time"</p>

<p>Originally intended to be four episodes to be displayed on British television (the BBC and Channel 4 and whatnot), they had the rug pulled under them by the networks. I think I know why.</p>

<p>Now, you'll be hard pressed to find a bigger Radiohead than myself (who hasn't gone to a concert, but I have valid reasons for that -- couldn't go to the last one as they played at that Whiteriver Amphitheater, which is controlled by Clearchannel Entertainment, and I have been boycotting those monopolisitc sons of bitches for a while now). As a rule, all of Radiohead's music videos have been gems of artistic prowess. Check out "Just" and you'll know what I mean.</p>

<p>However, what we've got here in, "The Most Gigantic Lying Mouth of all Time," is an hour and 45 minutes of chaos. Some of it's funny, much of it is visually stimulating, but as a whole it just appears that Radiohead got together and said, "Hey guys."</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"Well, blokes, I've been thinking."</p>

<p>"How's that going for you?"</p>

<p>"Quite well, I must say."</p>

<p>"Good, good. Say, did you see on the tele last night --"</p>

<p>"Wait, I wasn't finished."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure I'm sorry. Please continue."</p>

<p>"Well, as I was saying, I've been thinking,"</p>

<p>"And we're all quite impressed."</p>

<p>"Yes. I thought that maybe our fans are complete morons."</p>

<p>"Not difficult to prove that theory, mate."</p>

<p>"Very true. Which is why I was thinking that, since our fans are complete morons, surely they'd purchase a DVD with our name on it."</p>

<p>"Brilliant idea, ol' chap."</p>

<p>"Thank you. And, to prove how idiotic they really are, we should title the DVD 'The Most Gigantic Lying Mouth of all Time'. And, on this DVD, we'll just have a garbled mess of animation and live-action sequences set with the backdrop of our songs."</p>

<p>"Once again, you have astounded us with your brilliance."</p>

<p>"I know, I know. Now, I think we should take the lift out of our loft, smoke some fags, and play some pool. Don't forget your bumbershoot, it's raining outside again."</p>
