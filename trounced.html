Trounced Like A Monkey On Acid

</h1>

<h6>

<p>Trounced like a monkey on acid, the next time you see me I'll be knee-high in jagged clam shells, wading through a sea of chum and the blood from my shredded calves. Laughing like a mongrel shamed for pissing on the carpet, I'll tell you all, one by one, each to your faces, how much I admire the way you successfully alienate and embrace everything around you. If nothing else, I want you to know that there's plenty of light, plenty of oxygen, and not nearly enough solitude to accomplish everything I want to get done. Staring out of the window into the abyss lying there for me, I scramble to find an alternative for the shortness of breath I'm experiencing. Shallow, pallid, desperate for attention from those who loathe me most, I ride on, shamefully sobbing into my sleeve, blowing snot bubbles into the air as I choke on my own sense of self worth. Leaving home for the last time, I pray to anyone who'll listen, "Please sir, please dear one, give me the strength to punish my enemies, to strike down the innocent, to murder the harmless and the unaware alike."</p>
<p>I reach for my broadsword, taking a swipe into the air, tackling the invisible stonewall face-first. On the mantel, there's a photograph of Buddha and Charles Manson fucking in a sea of lion entrails. It didn't have to be this way. She could have been spared. Mercy was never my strong suit. Vengeance. Torture. Shameless reveling in all pleasures heathen. Heinous crimes against humanity spit in the face of innocence. And when all was said and done, I died, having left no impact less those whose loved-ones I'd conquered. On his tombstone, the epitaph read, "I'll wait for you as long as it's convenient for me. Once you're forgotten, don't bother coming back around again. You won't be missed and neither will I, so let's forego the pleasantries."</p>
<p>She wept regardless. He never would've understood why. All I know is what I've been taught in school. They never taught me the art of remorse. All he ever wanted was to see her corpse rotting in the sand. All she ever wanted was to see his robust face inches from hers. Desires unrequited: it happens all the time. </p>
