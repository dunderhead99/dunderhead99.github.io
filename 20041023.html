<p> I was a real Renaisance man today at work. I went number 1 in both toilets and the urinal twice, and I went number 2 in both toilets. All in an 8-hour shift.</p>

<p>So, I've been working with another temp all week from the same company as mine. And I still don't know her name. She's got this real Afro-centric name; I wanna say her name is Valita or . . . something that starts with a V. I guess I'm lucky I only have one more week to work with her. I guess that's what I get for having a shit memory when it comes to names.</p>

<p>I got another five hours of sleep last night. That wouldn't really be a problem, except when I got home today, I went to sleep around 5pm. And . . . I woke up at 1am. That's gonna fuck me all over for my sleep pattern this weekend. I'm supposed to be in Bellevue by noon to catch a ride with Jake up to Bellingham. If I can make it to 1am tomorrow, that's 24 hours. 24 hours where I'll be drinking, watching Ryan Stiles, drinking. And then I gotta wake my ass up around 8am to catch a ride back to Bellevue. This isn't gonna be pretty. Maybe I should go to church with Jake and his girlfriend, that should put me right to sleep.</p>

<p>You know, it's really hard to tolerate these people at work, but maybe that's because they're all women in their 30s and 40s. In the morning, there's only one other guy working and he's the boss. It sucks when you're sitting on the can, trying to read 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' while taking a shit during your morning break, and someone walks in to use the urinal. Because I know EXACTLY who it is and he does too. It also sucks to know that it takes him a REALLY long time to get his stream going; and that he doesn't wash his hands when he's done. There's just some things you don't want to know about people.</p>

<p>And, I don't think it's really much to ask. These women, I know they're married and have kids and all that, but come on! Run a comb through your hair! I mean, I don't know, maybe they're all on the rag at the same time, but would it kill you to wear something besides a sweat suit? Maybe throw a little make-up on, you KNOW that you need it! I know you're not much to look at, so why bother, right? WRONG! If I'm forced to work with you people, and I make the effort (OK, so there's not much hair to run a comb through, but I DO try to dress as presentable as my fashion sense allows), y'all MIWFs (Mothers I Wouldn't Fuck) could do the same.</p>

<p>I tried downloading Badder Santa and I think it killed my computer. Well, something's corrupt anyway.</p>

<br />OK, if I spelled one word wrong on minimal sleep (kinda like now), then I consider that a huge victory.</p>

<p>Woe is the man who runs checks for a living ... don't ever think ill of your candy-selling job ever again </p>
