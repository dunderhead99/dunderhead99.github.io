I'm Just Another Manic Mariners Fan.

</h1>

<h6>

<p>I'm more up-and-down on this Mariners season than a Tigger on Flubber. By the way, how'd you like that G-rated reference?</p>

<p>The Seattle Mariners - after sweeping the Boston Red Sox in three games - are going for the 3-game sweep of Toronto today (albeit, by sending Jeff Weaver to the mound). We've won 9 out of our last 10 games directly after losing 6 straight to some hapless NL Central losers, which in turn was directly after winning 10 of our previous 12 games.</p>

<p>I'm on again, I'm off again. Either the bandwagon is overburdened with support or it's completely deserted and falling apart due to disrepair. One week, I'm thinking to myself, "You know, a wild card could definitely be IN those cards if we can snag a solid starting pitcher." Then, we lose to the Cubs and the Astros and I'm thinking, "Fuck this! The Mariners are going nowhere faster than a pothead with a year's supply of Fudge-cicles." And then we come back to take down the best the AL East has to offer - along with Anaheim taking some unforeseen shots to the mouth from inferior opponents - and I've got us penciled in for a run in the AL West.</p>

<p>My heart disease can't take all these highs and lows right now. I'm going into an NFL season where it's Now-Or-Never for the Seahawks, I'm going into an NBA season that might be my last as a Seattle fan, and that doesn't even scratch the surface of my affinity for the Seattle Storm and Thunderbirds! I need to just maintain my previous stance of cautious optimism and leave it at that.</p>

<p>By the way, you have no idea how hard it is for me to resist the urge to look ahead and see who we're playing after Toronto today. God damn Jeff Weaver, you better not fuck this up for me!</p>
