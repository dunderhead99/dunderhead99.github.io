Super Thoughts On The Game That Wasn't.

</h1>

<h6>

<p>Super.</p>

<p>When you're dealing with competitive sports and a corresponding playoff system leading to the pinnacle game that decides without a scrap of doubt which one team is the best for that particular season, there are assumptions about this final game and the teams involved.</p>

<p>You ASSUME that you're getting the two best teams in the league. Of course, that's nowhere near the case because the playoff system doesn't seed according to overall record, they seed by conference and go from there. This is more like the electoral process; there are two parties and while one party may have three or four overqualified candidates for President, they can only elect one as the party's nominee and regardless of how underqualified, you HAVE to have a candidate from the other party.</p>

<p>However, regardless of conference domination, you have to assume at the very least that both teams will be good and tested and that they'll at least be able to make a game of it, because we all know the old adage of On Any Given Sunday.</p>

<p>Ergo, you have to expect a certain level of skill and ability out of your Super Bowl contestants, and on Sunday we certainly did NOT see an elite level of skill OR ability.</p>

<p>We saw sloppy line play, poor tackling, errant throws, lack of awareness in the pocket, turnovers, lackluster running, and the game's best player - Randy Moss - completely shut down by a secondary not worthy to carry his jock. What's more, we saw Eli Manning win an MVP award over anyone on his defense who would've been far more worthy.</p>

<p>No one can argue against the Giants getting to this point because of their stout D. Super Bowl champions in years past who've relied on their stout D's got rewarded by having one member of that stout D winning the MVP. Ray Lewis, Dexter Jackson of Tampa Bay two years later, Larry Brown in the Neil O'Donnell Bowl, Richard Dent of the '85 Bears proved that even a lineman can win! Why wasn't it Tuck? Did he need to make ONE more play to seal the deal? Is three really and truly the magic number like Schoolhouse Rock says? As far as I can tell, Eli Manning made ONE play by avoiding a sack before hurling up an ill-advised long ball down the middle of the field in traffic and his receiver bailed him out by catching it on his helmet thanks to his 30+ inch vertical. Other than that, he blew the first drive where they settled for a field goal and was mostly ineffecutal until the fourth quarter. Conversely, the defensive line kept the Giants IN the fucking game for four fucking quarters. But they gave the award to the white boy with the "Manning" on his jersey.</p>

<p>Super.</p>
