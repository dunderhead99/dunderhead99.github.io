Foreigner vs. Foreigners.

</h1>

<h6>

<p>Foreigner is a crappy rock band from the 70s and 80s with hits such as "I Want To Know What Love Is" "Hot Blooded" and "Waiting For A Girl Like You."</p>

<p><em>Foreigners</em> are people who march in Downtown Seattle - supposedly 15-20 thousand strong - for equal rights. They scare the corporate establishment to the point that all white-bread honkies run away in fear, which in turn allows me to leave work at 3:30pm.</p>

<p>I like foreigners!</p>

<p>Foreigner, incidentally, is comprised of about 50% British people, each of whom chopped off their nuts, sold their souls to the devil, and made whopping amounts of cash pandering to 13 year old girls and like-testicled teenage boys.</p>

<p><em>Foreigners</em> are, for the most part, Hispanic in descent, railing against the U.S. government to have them stop the hypocrisy of bringing in cheap labor and then trying to kick them out once their use has been fulfilled. They're fighting for a cause, they have a legitimate gripe, and they're trying to make a difference in the world.</p>

<p>Foreigner will probably be around to the Emerald Queen Casino again real soon.</p>

<p>I like foreigners!</p>

<p><em>Foreigners</em> have been accused of taking American jobs, putting hard-working American folks out of work, out of home, out on the streets. Of course, these accusations ACTUALLY come from ignorant, lazy Americans, who can't see the real problem confronting them on a daily basis, so they use foreigners as an excuse for all of society's ills. Generally, they're the same fucking people who voted in this regime not once, but twice, and wonder why there's so much corruption going on in Washington. It's because YOU let it happen, not the foreigners.</p>

<p>Foreigner played mildly repulsive arena rock before selling out in the 80s, hiring Mutt Lange, and transforming into balladeers the likes of which have yet to be seen in our lifetime.</p>

<p>I hate <em>Foreigner!</em></p>

<p>Now, if you're like me, you're having a tough time thinking about any more necessary ways that Foreigner makes you want to take to the streets in revolt. You're thinking, "The time has come! We must enact change! We must stop Foreigner from ever reaching the media! We must alter history so Foreigner never existed in our country! Now is the time to close the borders to Foreigner! Send a clear message to the rest of the world that the United States government is taking a strong stand against Foreigner and any Foreigner-like peoples! We won't have your crappy music infiltrating our country ever again!"</p>

<p>Join me! Join me in putting an end to Foreigner! Let us rally in Downtown Seattle tomorrow at 4:30! Let us show the world what a dedicated bunch can do!!!</p>
