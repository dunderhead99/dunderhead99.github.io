Warm Love.

<h6>

<p>Tonight was no different.  She decided to perform my every living fantasy: on all fours aside my reclined La-Z-Boy, her back used as my beer-rest, motionlessly pumicing my corns.</p>
<p>I listened as she read off the night's baseball scores.  Then, she turned to me and said, "Don't get up; let me do all the work again."  I told her that'd be fine, "But first, could you get me another cold one?  Oh, and I believe that apple pie is cool enough.  Don't forget the vanilla ice cream."  She smiled and did as she was told.</p>

<p>The end.</p>
