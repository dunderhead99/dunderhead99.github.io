<p> You know, it's really just the lazy fuckers who don't do it. It's not like you can forget! It's all anyone talks about that day. You have a whole fucking day to do it, you can also have the option of doing it from home, days or weeks in advance. You're 18 fucking years of age, you need to be fucking voting!</p>

<p>I'm at my friend's aunt's house for a barbecue. He has cousins who are in and around 18 years old. We ask, just out of the blue, if anyone can name the current Vice President of the United States. There was two guys, three girls in the living room. They're going to be seniors in high school next year. Not one of them could think of the name Dick Cheney. I ask them if they could name the LAST Vice President. The guy who lost to our current PRESIDENT. Blank stares. - - - - Oh, I'm sorry, did I just pull my ass out and start shitting all over the table? Did I say something confusing? </p>

<p>Five kids, and they have no clue. My fucking 12 year old cousin knows who our vice president is. From about the second grade on, I have always known who the vice president was - beings as that was an election year and George H.W. Bush was running against Michael Dukakis. These kids who are going to be of a voter's age by election time this year, they had no clue. And I gave them the forms to register to vote. </p>

<p>This is the reason, people. You HAVE to know at least the top two politicians in our country. These are the people who essentially dictate how our lives are to be run. </p>

<p>Let's think about this. What is it, a little over or a little under 50% of the eligable population chooses to vote? That is fucking rediculous. When 18 year olds were given the right to vote back in the 1960s, there was still very little turn out. And, you want to know who they voted for? Richard Fucking Nixon. These kids are fucking idiots. If all of the right-thinking individuals (that would be, those who agree with ME) chose to vote, or at least a higher fucking percentage than we got now, this wouldn't even be a close contest. Bush would be fucking gone, but then again, he never would have been voted in in the first fucking place. </p>

<p>You can't fault people in our state, or the other west-coast states. They voted, for the most part, correctly. I'm talking about some of these freak southern, midwest, and southeastern states. I'm certain there are more than fucking bible-thumping, gun-toting, hick-ass, worthless piles of crap. But, for whatever reason, they don't care. They just don't care.</p>
