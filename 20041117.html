<p> From the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy:</p>

<p>Ford Perfect's theory on why humans talk so much: "If human beings don't keep exercising their lips, their brains start working."</p>

<p>I think I finally get why all my co-workers are so chatty all the time.</p>

<p>By the way, if you ever read this book, or the five-book "trilogy", you'll be happy to find the ultimate greatest literary character in the history of the written word. Marvin the Paranoid Android. He's a robot who's been programmed to have human emotion. Since he's got a brain "the size of a planet" and he's forced to do all these menial tasks, he's constantly depressed and depressing the fuck out of everyone around him. And he bemoans his condition CONSTANTLY. Hilarity ensues. (Incidently, I don't think this character has any link to the greatest rock song in the history of the recorded sound, Radiohead's "Paranoid Android" except for the title)</p>

<p>If I can follow that parenthetical tangent with a thought-tangent, songs with choruses suck for the most part. Perhaps that's over-stating it, but I'd have to go with my follow-up, songs without choruses tend to be BETTER. I just got this 3-CD compilation of some early shit from the Flaming Lips. One thing about this band I enjoy, from time to time, they'll frame a song around a spoken short story. The guy'll tell the story and the music'll be playing either along with it, or post-story. I'm telling you, Big Sarah (the band, not the "Kirstie Alley After A Chubby Bunny Contest" as she's been known to be referred to) needs to work in a short-story jam song. It'd be cooler than a conventional song with lyrics (plus, taking into account the fact that gallup polls state the suicide rate quadrupals when people hear any of us sing, I think this may be a necessity).</p>

<p>Only gay little dweebs read the funnies.
<br />Yeah, I read 'em all the time!</p>

<p>By the way, the 4-West flag football team just won two playoff games back to back. 33-22 in game one and 13-12 in game two. Here's to hoping we get our next game bumped back so Chipwich'll be able to play. We be fuckered otherwise. Here's to hoping the next game also takes place 4:30 or later so the starting left tackle (yours truly) will be able to play. Shit man, my one catch a game would be SORELY missed.</p>

<p>Current Mood: Nobody ... has any ideas?
<br />Current Music: 23 Mates Of State - La'Hov</p>
