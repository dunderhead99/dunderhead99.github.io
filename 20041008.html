<p> It's been a rough day. I got up this morning, put a shirt on, and a button fell off. I picked up my briefcase, and the handle came off. I'm afraid to go to the bathroom.</p>

<p>I'm not a sexy guy. I went to a hooker. I dropped my pants; she dropped her price.</p>

<p>I know I'm ugly. I stuck my head out a window and got arrested for mooning.</p>

<p>I tell you, with my doctor, I don't get no respect. Well, I told him I've swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills. He told me to have a few drinks and get some rest. </p>

<p>I tell ya when I was a kid, all I knew was rejection. My yo-yo, it never came back! </p>

<p>I asked my old man if I could go ice-skating on the lake. He told me, "Wait til it gets warmer."</p>

<p>I come from a stupid family. During the Civil War my great uncle fought for the west!</p>

<p>I could tell that my parents hated me. My bath toys were a toaster and a radio.</p>

<p>Last week my tie caught on fire. Some guy tried to put it out with an ax!</p>

<p>I met the surgeon general. He offered me a cigarette.</p>

<p>If it weren't for pick-pocketers, I'd have no sex life at all.</p>

<p>I knew a girl so ugly that she was known as a two-bagger. That's when you put a bag over your head in case the bag over her head breaks.</p>

<p>I was so ugly, my mother used to feed me with a slingshot!</p>

<p>When I was a kid I got no respect. The time I was kidnapped, and the kidnappers sent my parents a note they said, "We want five thousand dollars or you'll see your kid again."</p>

<p>With my dog I don't get no respect. He keeps barking at the front door. He don't want to go out. He wants me to leave.</p>

<p>Last week I saw my psychiatrist. I told him, "Doc, I keep thinking I'm a dog." He told me to get off his couch.</p>

<p>I worked in a pet store and people kept asking how big I'd get.</p>

<p>My wife and I were happy for twenty years. Then we met.</p>

<p>I'll tell ya, my wife and I, we don't think alike. She donates money to the homeless, and I donate money to the topless!</p>

<p>My wife likes to talk while she's making love. Last night, she called me up from the Holiday Inn. </p>

<p>One night I came home. I figured, let my wife come on. I'll play it cool. Let her make the first move. She went to Florida. </p>

<p>My doctor told me to watch my drinking. Now I drink in front of a mirror. </p>

<p>I drink too much. Way too much. My doctor drew blood. He ran a tab.</p>

<p>When I was born the doctor came out to the waiting room and said to my father, "I'm very sorry. We did everything we could...but he pulled through."</p>

<p>My father was stupid. He worked in a bank and they caught him stealing pens.</p>

<p>My mother had morning sickness after I was born.</p>

<p>My mother never breast fed me. She told me that she only liked me as a friend.</p>

<p>My father carries around the picture of the kid who came with his wallet.</p>

<p>One year they wanted to make me poster boy... for birth control.</p>

<p>I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent back a piece of my finger to my father. He said he wanted more proof.</p>

<p>My uncle's dying wish was to have me sitting on his lap. He was in the electric chair.</p>

<p>Once when I was lost I saw a policeman and asked him to help me find my parents. I said to him, "Do you think we'll ever find them?" He said, "I don't know kid. There are so many places they can hide."</p>

<p>I remember I was so depressed I was going to jump out a window on the tenth floor. They sent a priest up to talk to me. He said, "On your mark..."</p>

<p>When my old man wanted sex, my mother would show him a picture of me.</p>

<p>I had a lot of pimples too. One day I fell asleep in a library. I woke up and a blind man was reading my face.</p>

<p>My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday.</p>

<p>One time I went to a hotel. I asked the bellhop to handle my bag. He felt up my wife!</p>

<p>This morning when I put on my underwear I could hear the Fruit of the Loom guys laughing at me.</p>

<p>I'm a bad lover. Once I caught a peeping tom booing me.</p>

<p>My wife only has sex with me for a purpose. Last night she used me to time an egg.</p>

<p>It's tough to stay married. My wife kisses the dog on the lips, yet she won't drink from my glass!</p>

<p>My wife isn't very bright. The other day she was at the store, and just as she was heading for our car, someone stole it! I said, "Did you see the guy that did it?" She said, "No, but I got the license plate."</p>

<p>Last night my wife met me at the front door. She was wearing a sexy negligee. The only trouble was, she was coming home. </p>

<p>A girl phoned me and said, "Come on over. There's nobody home." I went over. Nobody was home!</p>

<p>A hooker once told me she had a headache.</p>

<p>I went to a massage parlor. It was self service.</p>

<p>I was making love to this girl and she started crying. I said, "Are you going to hate yourself in the morning?" She said, "No, I hate myself now."</p>

<p>I knew a girl so ugly, they use her in prisons to cure sex offenders.</p>

<p>I knew a girl so ugly, I took her to the top of the Empire State building and planes started to attack her.</p>

<p>I knew a girl so ugly, the last time I saw a mouth like hers it had a hook on the end of it.</p>

<p>I knew a girl so ugly, she had a face like a saint--a Saint Bernard!</p>

<p>I was tired one night and I went to the bar to have a few drinks. The bartender asked me, "What'll you have?" I said, "Surprise me." He showed me a naked picture of my wife.</p>

<p>During sex my wife always wants to talk to me. Just the other night she called me from a hotel.</p>

<p>My marriage is on the rocks again. Yeah, my wife just broke up with her boyfriend.</p>

<p>One day as I came home early from work, I saw a guy jogging naked. I said to the guy, "Hey buddy...why are you doing that for?" He said, "Because you came home early."</p>

<p>I went to see my doctor... Doctor Vidi-boom-ba. Yeah...I told him once, "Doctor, every morning when I get up and look in the mirror I feel like throwing up. What's wrong with me? He said, "I don't know, but your eyesight is perfect."</p>

<p>I told my dentist my teeth are going yellow. He told me to wear a brown necktie.</p>

<p>My psychiatrist told me I'm going crazy. I told him, "If you don't mind, I'd like a second opinion." He said, "All right. You're ugly too!"</p>

<p>When I was born the doctor took one look at my face, turned me over and said, "Look, twins!"</p>

<p>And we were poor too. Why, if I wasn't born a boy, I'd have nothing to play with!</p>

<p>Guy goes into a bar with a duck under his arm. Bartender says, "Where'd you get the pig? Guy says, "This is a duck." Bartender says, "I was talking to the duck."</p>
