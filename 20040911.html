<p> The unthinkable has finally happened. I actually got beat. TWICE! This is not a good way to go into next week's showdown against E-rok and the Vers.</p>

<p>What was supposed to be a light tune-up vs. the Tacoma brood turned into a rumble against bitter foes from Redmond. Kon and Andrés came down for an afternoon double-header.</p>

<p>Game 1: Redmond Vs. Tacoma. Me, Jake and my brother vs. the gruesome twosome. And we got SPANKED. With Andrés throwing 80+ MPH heat, we were no match, not registering our first (and only) hit against him in the 6th inning on an ill-advised slow-pitch curve ball knocked into the gap for a double by yours truly. I gave up 5 runs in my first 5 innings, went ouf for the sixth and promptly walked two and gave up two more runs before my day was done. 6 IP, 7 ER. And, our team lost 16-0, even WITH C-man pitching for the last two innings.</p>

<p>Game 2 we switched it up. Tacoma was heavily outmatched. With me and Kon vs. Jake and Andrés, the game went scoreless through the first 7 and a half innings (with me pitching the first-ever 2 pitch inning, followed by a 3 pitch inning). Kon and I left runners stranded in scoring position all day, and in the bottom of the 8th, our defense gave out. Two hard luck errors, including a ball I SHOULD have caught near the fence, followed by a hit-batsman and a walk on five pitches forced in their only run, unearned. With that, our fate was sealed. In the top of the ninth, I stranded a runner at third base and that was the end of it. </p>

<p>Two losses in the same day. It's been quite a long time since I've had such a bad day. </p>

<p>But, next week that all changes. IF the Vers and E-rok are man enough to show up, I'm guaranteeing a victory. Yes, I know Eric throws a million miles an hour and could probably hit my pitches a country mile. Still, as the game goes on, I get stronger. Here's to hoping Chipwich runs out of gas.</p>

<p>And next time, I won't drink so heavily the night before. I don't know how these ballplayers get so shitfaced all the time and then go out and play the next day. I haven't peed right all day.</p>

<p>I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little disappointed.

<br />Dammit Steve, I was really hoping that you were going to be undefeated when me and Eric came down to take care of business. I wanted the honor of being on the first team of the season to take you down, and now that is all spoiled. Oh well, I guess I will have to settle for continuing your losing streak. Oh, I'm ready for you. I've gotta check with Eric, but I think everything is in line for another ass whipping next weekend.</p>

<p>-The Vers </p>
