Seattle Sports Roundup.

</h1>

<h6>

<p>God, you know the scholars at the U-Dub are having a FIT! Get ready, because they're about to pile in MILLIONS of dollars worth of renovations into Husky Stadium (in the future, possibly known as Taco Del Mar Field? One can only hope). Apparently, they're doing away with the track in there and bringing seats closer to the field, which should provide for a bigger home-field advantage (that is, should fans decide to start showing up to games again). And, it looks like they're paving the way for luxury boxes/seats and maybe even some name-brand concessions.</p>

<p>Of course, that means yet again, the UW Philosophy Department will go without heating or lights for their oh-so-important-and-revenue-generating classes. Ahh well, gotta break some eggs.</p>

<p class="indent">Love my girl, she lookin' good.</p>

<p>Has anyone else noticed how fucking retarded Major League Baseball is? And I don't just mean at the moment, I mean for the last DECADE! I'm sorry, but Adam Eaton should NEVER be a highly sought-after prized pitcher! Then again, I guess I shouldn't be too surprized. I mean, if Brandon Webb can win a Cy Young award, David Eckstein can win a World Series MVP, and some dude from the Twins can snag an AL MVP over Derek Jeter, there truly is no God.</p>

<p>But, I'm looking squarely at the Seattle Mariners on this one. I guess it looks like we're set on Hernandez, Washburn, and three BIGGER lumps of crap as our starting rotation then? Jason Schmidt actually WANTS to play for the Mariners and we're dragging our heels? Hemming and hawing over trivial details like 3 years over 4? Are you FUCKING kidding me? Our Great Offseason Plan is to see if we can work out a Freddy Garcia trade, so he can continue passing down bad habits to Felix from close range? I mean, it's like our General Manager is playing Yahtzee, only instead of going for something useful, he's gonna stop on one roll and take the three points on 1's. Unfuckingbelievable.</p>

<p class="indent">Trade in your hours for a handful of dimes.</p>

<p>Can my cynic's heart truly believe that Clay Bennett is trying to find a King County home for the Sonics? Tough to say, because I could see him do a lot more and still fail because our fucking legislature doesn't know their asses from the hole in the fucking sports community they're creating with this push to eradicate Seattle from the NBA landscape. This ain't the Cleveland Browns, you don't always get a second chance with these things. Seattle had a baseball team in the 40s; they left and we didn't see another one until 1977. We lose the Supersonics now and I don't see us getting another team for a LONG time.</p>

<p>Then again, to sit here and watch a team with two prime all star type players underperforming the way they are - not that I've actually been able to literally watch a game, but I read the damn papers everyday - what's the fucking point, right? We draft center after center only to see them get injured or fade into obscurity; we bring in supposed character guys who turn into whining bitches because they can't accept the role they've been brought in to do; our coach is a chicken with his fucking head cut off, who was so incompetent he couldn't even take the Spurs with an MVP center by the name of David Robinson to the promised land, who keeps flipping around his rotation every week even though he knows players don't like that.</p>

<p>The Sonics have made a lot of dumbass moves over the years - at least since the 1996 Finals season - but of the idiotic things they've done in recent years, letting Nate McMillan go coach the Trailblazers has to be number one. He had us performing in a playoff series against San Antonio we had NO business being in. Then, we dick around, lowball him, and force his hand. We should've been on top of the thing, giving him an extension LONG before his contract ran out. Fucking shit.</p>

<p class="indent">They got the guns but, we got the numbers.</p>

<p>It's a good thing we have the Seahawks. Can't seem to get more than one sports team to succeed at any one time. Too bad I don't see 'em winning in Denver this week. That's no crack in favor of Jay Cutler; that's seeing Tatum Bell running for 300 yards on our defense.</p>
