<p> I've officially become a watered-down version of The Man.</p>

<p>And I don't even get a FUCKING nightstick!</p>

<p>You're looking at the latest SRO (that's Special Response Officer) for Northwest Protective Services. </p>

<p>Or, as I've dubbed it, Rent-A-Lameass-Cop.</p>

<p>I make 10 dollars an hour instead of the normal 8 dollars, because my schedule isn't fixed. </p>

<p>As it stands now, this week, or as I should put it, in the next 7 days, I will be working a total of 66 hours. But, that's not the same PAY period, see? It's split 20 and 46 or something, so I should be making hella-overtime the first week out.</p>

<p>Here's the bad news. I don't get to go on the family camping trip this year. I'm fucking BUMMED about that. It was supposed to be 4 days, well I guess 3 days of drinking and one day of hangover. Now, that's out. It's funny, before the job, I could go but I couldn't really AFFORD it. Now I can and I can't go. I guess that's the way it's gonna be a lot for a while.</p>

<p>I'm hoping I can still make that other camping trip on the third weekend of August. </p>

<p>Hey, one bright side! I still get to wish Mark and Mario off on Monday, which will be my only day off. ASS for today, I've got to stay up as late as I can, because I start working tomorrow (Friday) at 21:00 (that's 9:00 for you lay-me people). </p>

<p>Now, it's Mariners game (in which the Mariners ALREADY beat Oakland, so their win might be used up for the series), then back here to stay up until the crack of Howard Stern.</p>

<p>Don't cry for me, because I'm already dead.</p>

<p>Current Mood: Hel-lo DENTAL PLAN!

<br />Welcome to the world of shitty jobs with long hours, bad hours, and low pay. </p>
