<em>Little Things</em>, by Raymond Carver.

</h1>

<h6>

<p>Early that day the weather turned and the snow was melting into dirty water. Streaks of it ran down from the little shoulder-high window that faced the backyard. Cars slushed by on the street outside, where it was getting dark. But it was getting dark on the inside too.</p>

<p>He was in the bedroom pushing clothes into a suitcase when she came to the door.</p>

<p>I'm glad you're leaving! I'm glad you're leaving! she said. Do you hear?</p>

<p>He kept on putting his things into the suitcase.</p>

<p>Son of a bitch! I'm so glad you're leaving! She began to cry. You can't even look me in the face, can you?</p>

<p>Then she noticed the baby's picture on the bed and picked it up.</p>

<p>He looked at her and she wiped her eyes and stared at him before turning and going back to the living room.</p>

<p>Bring that back, he said.</p>

<p>Just get your things and get out, she said.</p>

<p>He did not answer. He fastened the suitcase, put on his coat, looked around the bedroom before turning off the light. Then he went out to the living room.</p>

<p>She stood in the doorway of the little kitchen, holding the baby.</p>

<p>I want the baby, he said.</p>

<p>Are you crazy?</p>

<p>No, but I want the baby. I'll get someone to come by for his things.</p>

<p>You're not touching this baby, she said.</p>

<p>The baby had begun to cry and she uncovered the blanket from around his head.</p>

<p>Oh, oh, she said, looking at the baby.</p>

<p>He moved toward her.</p>

<p>For God's sake! she said. She took a step back into the kitchen.</p>

<p>I want the baby.</p>

<p>Get out of here!</p>

<p>She turned and tried to hold the baby over in a corner behind the stove.</p>

<p>But he came up. He reached across the stove and tightened his hands on the baby.</p>

<p>Let go of him, he said.</p>

<p>Get away, get away! she cried.</p>

<p>The baby was red-faced and screaming. In the scuffle they knocked down a flowerpot that hung behind the stove.</p>

<p>He crowded her into the wall then, trying to break her grip. He held on to the baby and pushed with all his weight.</p>

<p>Let go of him, he said.</p>

<p>Don't, she said. You're hurting the baby, she said.</p>

<p>I'm not hurting the baby, he said.</p>

<p>The kitchen window gave no light. In the near-dark he worked on her fisted fingers with one hand and with the other hand he gripped the screaming baby up under an arm near the shoulder.</p>

<p>She felt her fingers being forced open. She felt the baby going from her.</p>

<p>No! she screamed just as her hands came loose.</p>

<p>She would have it, this baby. She grabbed for the baby's other arm. She caught the baby around the wrist and leaned back.</p>

<p>But he would not let go. He felt the baby slipping out of his hands and he pulled back very hard.</p>

<p>In this manner, the issue was decided.</p>
