<h6>

<p> - A full roll of toilet paper in the bathroom.
<br />- Downloaded U2 album and Nirvana Boxed Set
<br />- 250 MB of space on my Hotmail account
<br />- Not having a governor until Christmas or later
<br />- An empty bathroom and a clean toilet (yes, I have to poop as we speak)
<br />- A day off and 13 hours of sleep last night
<br />- Massive amounts of touchdowns by Reggie Wayne to propell me to a victory over Kon in Fantasy Football
<br />- The ability to Prarie Dog like no other
<br />- My MP3 player rocking all ass around town
<br />- Red Stripe Jamaican Lager
<br />- Moving out in a month and a week
<br />- Knowing what I'm getting for Christmas (Simpsons Seasons 4 and 5, Looney Tunes Golden Collection 4-DVD set Volume 2, Family Guy Series)
<br />- Passing gas, providing me a stay of execution for another five minutes
<br />- Plenty of John Wayne stamps to send my brother letters (P.S. it takes about a fucking week to get these letters through the fucking US government)
<br />- Seattle Supersonics 11-2; Portland Trailblazers 6-5 (SUCK ON THAT, NATE!)
<br />- Lube
<br />- Highway 99 when I-5 sucks flakey balls
<br />- Having no hair means I have no dandruff
<br />- Long Johns, so I can run in the cold weather
<br />- My sphincter can bench press 145 pounds; my poop doesn't stand a chance
<br />- Having a pen in my billfold so I can write out story ideas while I'm driving, thereby making me the most hazardous driver on the freeway WITHOUT a cell phone
<br />- The O.C. mouse pad
<br />- $50 dollar rebate for MP3 player
<br />- No Rain (the weather, not the song; though I'll take any opportunity I can to flout Sublime and tout Blind Melon for being the better of the two bands with the overdosed lead singer)
<br />- High School Girls (I keep gettin' older, they stay the same age)
<br />- White women (What's the secret to happiness?) -- Stop that.
<br />- Colt 45
<br />- Rolling Stone Magazine (Still on the John Kerry issue; I'm still sticking to my ban on anything political or anything news related . . . it's all cartoons and sports from here on out for me)
<br />- Reading Rolling Stone Magazine while taking a shit, which I will be doing shortly (I'm sorry sir, that book has been red-flagged)
<br />- and finally, Wilco, for putting out the best album of 2004 with "A Ghost is Born" (download - "At Least That's What You Said" & "Company In My Back" & "The Late Greats")</p>

<p>With honorable mentions to:</p>

<p>The Mooney Suzuki - Alive and Amplified (download - "Shake That Bush Again" & "Alive and Amplified")
<br />Pearl Jam - Live at Benaroya Hall (download - "Masters of War" & "25 Minutes To Go")
<br />Modest Mouse - Good News for People Who Love Bad News (download - "Bury Me With It")
<br />The Prodigy - Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned (download - "Memphis Bells")
<br />Green Day - American Idiot (download - "Jesus of Suburbia")
<br />The Hives - Tyrannosaurus Hives (download - "B is for Brutus")
<br />The Killers - Hot Fuss (download - "Midnight Show")
<br />Franz Ferdinand (download - "Auf Achse")
<br />Bumblebeez 81 - The Printz (download - "Pony Ride")
<br />The Walkmen - Bows + Arrows (download - "Little House of Savages")</p>

<p>I tried not to include the singles in these recommendations, but with the Mooney Suzuki I had to. It's too fucking good.</p>

<p>Eat turkey and sleep plenty, people. I'm gonna go relieve my tired bowels now.</p>

<p>Current Mood: You never hear it on the radio
<br />Current Music: U2 - Miracle Drug</p>

<br />Yeah, you'll notice I wasn't thankful for family, good health, this here roof over my head or that there food on my table. Sometimes these things slip my mind, but there are two things I forgot to be thankful for:</p>

<p>Preperation H and Preperation H Raymond. </p>
