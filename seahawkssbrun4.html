Super Bowl XL Poem.

</h1>

<h6>

<p>Mark is a whore,
<br />The Steelers suck more
<br />Nobody buys into their bullshit lore</p>

<p>Fuck all the Steelers hype
<br />I'd beat them with a pipe
<br />Then bitchslap their coach if he decides to gripe</p>

<p>Don't forget about us
<br />When you're praising the Bus
<br />All we do is win baby, no fuss, no muss</p>

<p>We'll crush Porter's dream
<br />With our cockerific team
<br />Shoving it in his ass, making him scream</p>

<p>Your quarterback's young
<br />His swan-song has sung
<br />And his face looks like it's been slathered in dung</p>

<p>You defense don't scare me
<br />Because our offense, you see
<br />Will be raging down the field unstoppably</p>

<p>It's time to shut you down
<br />Make you cry, make you frown
<br />While they sleep in Pittsburgh, we'll be looting this town</p>

<p>When the Seahawks win, Mark just might
<br />Decide he wants to put up a fight
<br />But will probably just piss on my tail-light</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be
<br />On Sunday we'll see
<br />How well Steve handles a Seattle victory</p>

<p>Will he drink, will he cry?
<br />Will he suddenly turn bi?
<br />Or will he clutch his heart and peacefully die?</p>

<p>When cutting him open, it's true
<br />You'll find out the hue
<br />Of his blood squirts out not red but blue!</p>
