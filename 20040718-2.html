<p> Ladies, does it feel weird having a cottony thingy in your love hole, with a string sticking out? Is it anything like when you're wiping your ass and a tiny bit of toilet paper rips and stays up there, requiring a re-wipe?</p>

<p>Wait, is it THIS that keeps me from getting laid? It is, isn't it. I simply MUST stop using this question as a pick-up line to every woman I meet in a bar!</p>

<p>Current Mood: Time to Sleep
<br />Current Music: Phish - Tweezer (live) -- "Please Her With A Tweezer!"</p>
