They don't call Happy Meals "Cancer Bags" so why do they call cigarettes "Cancer Sticks"?.

<p> Do you rent or own? ... Those wings, you ANGEL.</p>

<p>Dammit to puss-spewing blood-gutted hell!</p>

<p>Oh the lethargy. Haven't written anything of substance in QUITE some time. Why is drinking so much fun? I mean, I can't imagine how these famous authors managed to be alcoholics AND get as much shit done as they did. Really, all I'm doing here is half-assing both the writing and the alcoholism. They were using FULL ASS for BOTH. </p>

<p>I wanna write right now (I wanna rock-right-now. I wanna rock-right-now) but I'm not inspired enough. And, any wit I may have had during my good, long dry spell this winter/spring has completely dissipated.</p>

<p>So, when work starts up for me (oh, it'll start up, even if I have to flip burgers or empty out bedpans), I should be in a better frame of mind.</p>

<p>As for right now, meditation. I wanna finish this first fucking chapter of this new fucking book I'm trying to fucking write.</p>

<br />I just realized that I've never actually been to your Livejournal site. I've always read your posts through my friends page. Weird. Nice color scheme.</p>
